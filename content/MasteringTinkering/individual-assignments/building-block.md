# Building Block Progress Week 1
The design assignment was to come up with your own design of a construction/building block for which in next session we were going to build a physical prototpye. For my building block I first started making a lot of different sketches which can be seen below. I started with thinking about a lot of different shapes and existing building blocks. After that I tried to combine parts to get a new building block.

With the block itself more clear I started thinking about different ways to connect the blocks. After I made all the sketches I looked back and looked at what would be feasible to make. I chose the square form since it can be easily modelled and I chose to connect the block with magnets since they are versitile to use and connect blocks in different places. Magnets are also a part which does not break easily compared to a 3d printed interlocking system.

# Building Block Progress Week 2

I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems were not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. I also tried printing other models but the problems remained. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don't they get on your nerves! The problem was not solveable within this week so I went to Designlab to get it printed. Below you can see the results!

I tried making the alternative model but came to the conclusion that it is difficult to connect the square with a pentagon. So I let that one be an idea that was not executed. It can however still be a fun thing to later explore how to connect different shapes easily and maybe design a block that has different sides, for example having both squares and pentagons.
