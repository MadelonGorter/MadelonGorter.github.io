# Explanation of ranking
For the material table I chose the criteria of self guiding, preciousness, skills needs, interoperability, seeing the process and seeing the results. I chose these criteria since I felt like they support creativity, exploration and learning by doing. The criteria appeared in the "Designing for Tinkerability" chapter and in affordances by Norman. My definitions of the criteria are:
- Self guiding: Does it guide you into how to use it?
- Preciousness: Is what you make and the material valuable?
- Skills needed: Can you use it without needing to develop a skill?
- Interoperability: Does it work with other materials?
- Seeing the process: Do you see what is happening during the process?
- Seeing the results: Do you see the results when you are done?

I used a ranking system consisting of plusses and minusses. The meaning in general is
- ++: Excellent
- +: Good
- +-: Neutral
- -: Poor
- --: Very poor
