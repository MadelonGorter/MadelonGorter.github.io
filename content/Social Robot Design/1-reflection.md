## Pointers from Social Robots from a Human Perspective Chapter 8
The pointers from chapter 8 include:
- Sharing robot projects open-source encourages people to make their own social robot and broaden the field of social robotics but also make robots more accessible.
- Using a multidisciplinary approach and gathering projects from different fields to make social robots
- Assessing humanoid factors through: discussing the level of intuitiveness of an artifact; describing the interaction channels of the artifact from the viewpoint of the
pragmatic of human communication; measuring the face-ism index of the artifact; defining the position of the artifact in the uncanny valley diagram
- Designing a robotic interface is complex due to lack of standards and it being in development stages in which it is difficult to combine all the different tech parts
- Importance of having a face as interface that is intuitive and familiar for people to have an interaction
- Engaging users in design leads to more relevant and accepted social robot designs in the case of InMoov, iCub and Ono.

## Chapter 9 Embodiment vs Digital Content
The general statements that can be made regarding embodiment vs ditigal content are:
- A mobile phone can be seen as a social robot since they provoke strong emotional responses and create bonds with people even though they do not have a very much physical embodiment of a social robot since they only consist out of a screen and haptic feedback
- Creating an emotional connection with people is done through personalized content and not through physical interaction 
- Currently a lot of people are already addicted to their screen which means that they adapted to screens and do not always need a human face to interact with something.

We do not always need actuators because people are able to attribute personality and emotion to for example a phone in which only digital interaction is used

The parts of embodiment that turn a smartphone into a social robot are:
- A personality that stays the same
- Changing behavior
- Giving feedback
- Timing when to say what
- Able to understand context

## My perspective after watching 'Her'
In the movie 'her' the embodiment is not really present since Samantha does not have a body however still the relationship can be felt through the connection she creates. This is done through having certain rituals, being responsive, having a memory and also having a voice. This gives Samantha a character which can be seen by a human and changes the look for me from an actual robot that is social to creating an interaction which has certain features from which a human can sense trust and familiarity. 

## Vincent vs Bar-Cohen
When comparing the focus of Vincent with Bar-Cohen it becomes clear that Vincent focuses on the cultural, ethical and psychological dimensions of human-robot interaction while Bar-Cohen is more optimistic and looks at the use of technology to make humanoids acceptable in different types of fields such as the healthcare and a household. 

The real-world deviated from the predicted revolution since humanoid robots are still not very acceptable since they are too complex and expensive but also unnecessary for many tasks. People are very much focussed on their privacy and stand up against the ethical challenges that arise with social robots. The social acceptance is still low and slowed down the integration of robots in everyday life. However another type of robot became popular which are the smart assistants such as Alexa and Siri. 

## Robot Hotel 
The robot hotel was a hotel which promised automation through using humanoid robots when comparing the robot hotel with the CitizenM hotel which uses automation it becomes clear that the focus of the robot hotel was wrong. They failed since their UX was not strong enough to keep guests away from usability issues and frustration. The humanoid robots were too annoying and often broke down which was not worth the trouble. They tried making different robots for a lot of different features which could easily be handled by people themselves. The robot should add functional or emotional value and that was not the case it only created trouble.

## Nabaztag Rabbit
Nabaztag is a communicating object in the shape of a rabit, it had a sort of personality which had ears, lights and speech. It fits the definition of a social robot since it tries to have a personality with emotional responses and a physical interface. It was not successfull due to the use of the robot being very unclear, responsiveness was not that great and it depended on the network which did not work great and was technically fragile in general. The design was ahead of its time but the emotional connection was not there enough and prove unsuccessful.

## Cuddlebits Paper
The key insights in the role and application of design research in the Cuddlebits projects are:
- Minimal robots which can show different emotions
- Building emotions from rhythm, haptics and expectations
- Helps make clear the feelings people had about about the robot and the trustworthiness
- Focussing on legibility of emotions through subtle movements and engaging users through adapting to robots behavior
