## Categorisation for Robot/AI stories
The categorisation I can come up with for Robot/AI stories is that you can divide them into three main categories namely themes, purposes and emotional response. With the three categories more subcategories can be made in which the main ones are combined.

- Moral dilemmas in which real-world problems are challenged by robots/AI
- Reshaping humans and society through telling stories about changing human identity or society in general with robots/AI
- Emotional support in which robots/AI have roles in which they are like a friend or companion to a human
- Dystopian stories in which fears that currently exist about robots/AI are blown up and become true such as taking over the world
- Utopian stories in which the world can be saved by robots/AI and they are praised contradicting the dystopian stories

## Johnson B.D. Approach and Differences
Johnson introduced Science Fiction Prototyping as a method to imagine and explore future technologies through storytelling. Johnson advocates the following five step process for writing Science Fiction Prototypes:
1. Pick Your Science and Build Your World
2. Identify the Scientific Inflection Point
3. Consider ramifications of the Science on People
4. Identify the Human Inflection Point
5. Reflect on what Did We Learn?

The difference between Science Fiction Prototyping (SFP) and Generic Scenario-Based Design (SBD) is that SFP uses storytelling to understand and change the human experience with future technologies while SBD develops specific use cases to inform design decisions and usability. Next to that they are also different in outcome since SBD tries to improve the functionality or user experience of a product and SFP on the other hand is more about opening up a discussion and reflecting on implications that future technologies might have. SFP is more broad and about what the future can bring while SBD is specific and practical.

## 21st Century Robot Project and NOA-like Personality
The 21st Century Robot project aimed to create a customizable, open-source robot platform. The robot became NAO-like since the robot had predictable behavior since all the tasks and interactions were scripted. Next to that the robot had a friendly appearance which made it look very approachable and non-threatening. Choosing different storytelling or design approaches could have led to a robot which was not looking friendly and no full control of the interaction but could be more dynamic. 

## Storytelling in Consumer Robotics
Consumer robots are often marketed as friendly, being a companion and being intelligent. These stories can differ from reality since robots often lack real intelligence, autonomy and emotions. But also often do not have all the features that are being told about since they are technically unachievable. The stories often disappoint users and are misleading.

## Storytelling Considerations in SRD
The storytelling aspects which you should consider when designing social robots are:
- Backstories: A background story for a robot can help create relatability and connection.
- Personality: Creating a robot that has well-defined and consistent personality features helps users to predict the behavior of the robot
- Roles: Stating which purpose and capabilities the robot has makes sure that users expectations align with the robot functionalities.

The uncanny valley is where entities that closely resemble humans but are not quite lifelike, elicit discomfort. This can be linked to the story since a difference in appearance and behavior of the robot can create a dissonance for users which can cause discomfort for users.
