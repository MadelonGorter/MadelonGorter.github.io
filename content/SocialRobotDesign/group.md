## Session 2: Story Building
During the session we first used the Design Tools for Innovation to categorize them as tools that could be usefull for creating scenarios. In the picture below our division can be found.

### Existing Scenario Tools
We started by making a quick overview of the tools that were in the assignment with ChatGPT to use as a starting point for choosing the scenario tools. It provided the following overview of various scenario tools with their strengths and weaknesses. 

| Tool | Description | Strengths | Weaknesses |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Scripts** | Written dialogues or interactions between the user and the product | Fast, intuitive, and focuses on flow | Can miss spatial/contextual detail |
| **Storyboards** | Sequential images showing interaction moments | Visual highlights emotion | Time-consuming, may oversimplify |
| **Play-Acting / Role Play** | Acting out a scenario with/without props | Embodied, real-time feedback | Needs group participation, may feel awkward | 
| **Stop Motion / Animation** | Mini-films that illustrate scenarios | Engaging, repeatable, remote-friendly | Requires some media skills | 
| **Cards (e.g. IDEO Method Cards)** | Prompts or building blocks for scenario creation | Quick, accessible | Can feel generic without customisation | 
| **Digital Tools: Storyboard That, Miro, Figma, Twine** | Tools for scripting, visual layout, and branching interaction | Flexible, collaborative | Can be overwhelming or not tailored to robot-specific needs | 

### Proposed Scenario Tool
With the options in mind we soon made the decision the combine scripts and cards since they were the ones that stood out to us. After choosing these tools we searched for scientific articles about how these tools are grounded and wrote a text about this. 

From the research it became clear that Xu et al. [1] identified several challenges with scenario-based evaluation in the field of Human Robot Interaction (HMI). These challenges include the confidence of participants with the used media, so paper paper-based tools or digital media (videos). Another problem is the lack of interactivity, which leads to a failure to capture the dynamic relationship of human–robot interactions. Scenarios also often fail to include the dynamic real-world situations, missing details and adaptability to these situations. Scenarios might fail to represent social and emotional cues in live interactions, which are of great importance in assessing human-robot interaction.

To account for these limitations, the decision was made to combine scripts with a set of prompt cards. The script can be an empty template, with lines for the robot and the human the robot interacts. This allows participants to design the scenario, turn by turn, which is similar to real conversations. The prompt cards will include different personas, locations, actions and emotions. Based on these cards, the script will be written, providing a scenario that can provide various insights. 

One of the limitations mentioned is the dynamic real-world conversations. In real life, people often wait for their turns instead of talking over each other. Robots use this turn-based logic, and using scripts as a scenario-building tool will mimic this. In scripts, clear planning of responses and events is used. Mateas and Stern [2] use scripting to manage difficult and real-time interaction between users and AI characters. This work shows how scripting can make human-computer interaction dynamic and use emotions. 

To support this, Murray and Maher [3] explore how trajectories in interactive narratives can help structure and develop behaviour-focused human-computer systems. By leveraging these principles in Human Robot Interaction, the proposed tool encourages thinking about how interactions evolve over time, not solely as isolated events. 

### Developing a Scenario for the Chosen Tools
On the left side of the tool in yellow, there will be a pile of described input cards that can help build or prompt the script. To the right, you can see the templates for the script, which can be filled in while using the input cards. A benefit of this tool is that you can easily mimic and create real-life applications and determine what would work and what wouldn’t work. In both scenario’s the tool helped structure dynamic conversations between humans and robots, leveraging a turn-taking model. The use of prompt cards ensures variety and helps steer the conversation so that it is not a completely random script. The visual layout helped us in collaborating as a team, the collaboration helped identify gaps or unrealistic responses. This tool is specifically designed for relevant storytelling in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by offering a structured, collaborative environment to simulate and evaluate interactive scenarios between humans and robots.

One of the limitations of this tool is creating fully realistic emotional responses. This requires more nuanced input cards. This could be achieved by acting out the scenarios or providing this script as inspiration for something like improv theatre. The tool for now is focused on shorter narratives and quickly discovering if an application of a robot would seem logical or not. For future development, longer or evolving narratives, potentially with branching, would be needed to create more realistic stories. An addition that can be made is conflict cards, to introduce problems or tension, maybe even potential problems that can arise from interaction with the robot. This could help design scenarios that overcome these design problems. ‘Wild’ cards can also be added to involve unexpected events, to stimulate speculative thinking, and to design with the unexpected in mind.
