title: "About me!"


---


My name is Madelon Gorter. I love to wind and wave surf! Below is a picture of me teaching windsurfing at Surfin 24! In my bachelor I studied CreaTe and am now doing the Interaction Technology Master. I like to 3D print and design solutions for people with a problem, more specifically people with a disability. I want to give everyone the change to have a personalized product that is able to support them.
