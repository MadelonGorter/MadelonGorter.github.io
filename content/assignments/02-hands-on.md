# Week 2 Reflective Questions

I was not physically present during session two and received some information from peers but that was not very useful. I looked into the concept of Affordance and searched for all the different materials online to make the material table. The table can be found on the material table tab.

The concept of affordance is used to give a better understanding about what makes materials good for tinkering. The concept of affordance can be viewed from two perspectives, namely Gibson and Norman. Gibson is focussed on the ecological psychology [1] and Norman used the human-computer interaction (HCI) framework [2].

Gibson in 1977 defined affordance as "offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill" [3] So in other words it refers to all action possibilities with an object based on user's physical capabilities [4]. 

In 1988 Norman introduces the concept of affordance to the design community and changed the definition a bit so it could be easier used for designers [4]. He defined it as "perceivable action possibilities" in other words only actions which users consider possible. Designer must keep  affordances in mind when designing product or services since elements of their design suggest how user can use their product or services. 

Connecting the concept of affordance to tinkering materials shows us that the materials that have clear affordances help people tinker. They invite people to start exploring and use the materials in different ways. Materials that suggest that they can be used in multiple ways encourage creativity, learning and experimentation.

From the chapter "Designing for Tinkerability" it also becomes clear that they emphaze to create an environment and tools that support open-ended exploration and invention. Their view on making designs that are intuitive and invite interaction closely relate to Norman and his view on the perceived affordances. Through the use of materials and tools that suggest their functionalities, a tinkering mindset is encouraged. 

Combining all of the frameworks and opinions this means that in tinkering, materials that have multiple functionalities and that suggest their possibilities need to be designed or used to encourage exploration. This helps people to know what we can do with things just by looking or touching them [4].
