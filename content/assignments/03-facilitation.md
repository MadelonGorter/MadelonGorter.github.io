Which concepts are relevant?

## Invent to Learn Chapter 5
Summarise the key principles mentioned by Papert and also the key principles by Montessori. Where do Papert and Montessori meet up? What is a fundamental difference in their approach? How well do their mantra's and thoughts on teaching translate to tinkering for 'children of different ages'?

## Invent to Learn Chapter 9
What are useful pointers for the space (location) and setting, what is the message? Do you need a designlab/fablab?

## Practice as a Designer/Engineer

Now get back to your own practice as a designer/engineer:
- where in a process do you use tinkering?
- how can you translate a design problem or research problem into a tinkering playground?
- what can you use to get unstuck?
- how do you get in the flow?
