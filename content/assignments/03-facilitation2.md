# Week 3 Reflective Questions

## LEGO Serious Play
#### Role of Adults in Facilitation? 
Children are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO. Adults might need more encouragement to start, be creative and keep going assuring them that they can not do something wrong. Adults have not played in a long time so some start up time should also be kept in mind.

#### Relevant Concepts
- Hands-on: using your hands to express your thoughts
- Metaphors: expressing ideas with metaphors that can be found in the LEGO
- Sharing & Safety: making sure people speak up and listen to what others say in a safe, non-judgmental environment.

## Teaching: Papert & Montessori
From the Invent to Learn book chapter 5 multiple key principles by Papert and Montessori can be identified.
#### The Key Principles of Papert
- Constructionism: Learning happens when people are actively making something they care about.
- Learning through tinkering: Using a hands-on, trial-and-error approach to learning. Children should experiment, build, and refine their ideas through iterative design cycles
- Powerful ideas and microworlds: Learning should be about powerful ideas, concept that have lasting significance and can be applied in multiple contexts. While using microworlds, self-contained digital environments where learners could experiment with complex concepts in a simplified setting
- Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls: design learning environments that have a 
    - Low floor: easy to get started
    - High ceiling: allowing for deep and complex explorations
    - Wide walls: encouraging creativity
- Personal curricula: Education should be based on self-directed exploration, teachers encourage tinkering and learning together
- The role of computers: Using computers to extend cognitive abilities

#### The Key Principles of Montessori
- Hands-on learning: Learning through direct, physical interaction with materials
- Prepared environment: Design classrooms to promote independent learning, every material has specific purpose
- Intrinsic motivation and self directed learning: Children learn best when they follow their own curiosity, use materials that are self-correcting so children discover their mistakes on their own. 
- Freedom within limits: Children should have the freedom to choose their activities but within a carefully structured environment
- Mixed-age classrooms and peer learning
- Observation and adaption: Teachers act as guides, they step back and let children explore while intervening only when necessary

#### Overlap Between Papert and Montessori
Papert and Montessori both emphazise on active and hands-on learning and giving the children the space to decide what they want to learn. They encourage children to learn through doing and experimenting while keeping the level of instruction at the minimum. Children are encouraged to make mistakes and follor their own paths. 

#### Difference Between Papert and Montessori 
Paper and Montessori also have differences in their approach with the most prominent one being the use of technology. Papert uses computers as learning devices while Montessori prefers physical and meaningfull materials. They also differ in their way of structuring the environment around the children, Papert uses an open-ended and more explorative environment while Montessori uses a prepared environment in which children can do things within the boundaries of the environment. Lastly, Papert and Montessori also differ in their view of the role of a teacher. Papert mostly lets the teachers encourage the children to learn together and tinker while Montessori put the role as a teacher more as a guide which only intervene when necessary.

#### Tinkering for Children of Different Ages
For young children aged 3 to 6 both of the mantra are valuable since they encourage children to explore through a hands-on approach using different materials. When a child gets older (6-12 years) Papert introduces the use of computers which opens up a whole new world of problems to solve. While Montessori still uses the same materials but with more difficult problems. Teenagers in the Papert approach use even more programming while Montessori mostly focusses on for example applications of math. Montessori has great principles which work well for young children while Papert using the computers has more relevant principles for children growing up, especially in a world where digital tools are becoming more and more important. Combining hands-on learning with physical materials with digital problem solving sounds like a future proof approach to education.

## Shaping the Learning Environment 
#### Useful Pointers Space and Setting for Tinkering
From the Invent to Learn book chapter 9 multiple pointers are named, these useful pointers include: 
- Flexible & Adaptable
- Documentation
- Accessible Tools & Materials
- Culture of Experimentation

The message given is that learning spaces should intentionally be designed to foster creativity, agency and self-directed exploration. Makerspaces are not just about a place to use tools and materials but are about setting a mindset where poeple see themselves as inventors and problem-solvers.

#### Necessity of a Designlab/Fablab 
A designlab/fablab is not needed since the mindset about making and being an inventor can be used everywhere. The most important things are that the environment supports creativity and exploration.

## Practice as a Designer/Engineer
#### Using Tinkering
I use Tinkering in the ideation and prototyping phase of a project. In the ideation phase I use it to generate multiple ideas. In the prototyping phase I mostly use it to explore different features and test the prototypes.

#### Translating Design and Research Problems into a Tinkering Playground
A design or research problem can be translated into a tinkering playground through breaking it into smaller parts which can be solved by using open-ended materials. After solving the smaller parts it can be combined to solve the bigger problem. 

#### Getting Unstuck
Things to use when you get stuck are to use different materials then the ones currently used and also looking in the world around you to see how the problem can be seen in other ways so looking for an analogous solution. It can also be useful to involve others in your tinkering process to get different perspectives and solutions and work around the part were you are stuck at. Another option is to stop and go for a walk to give your brain some rest and focus on other things. 

#### Getting in the Flow
To get in the flow I make sure that people are not able to distract me and that there are a lot of different materials present. I feel like just starting and doing random stuff also helps to start the ideas. I mostly start sketching or making stuff with 3d modelling or LEGO blocks to see which options can be found. After the first options are there you can explore one of the options or generate more options. I can completely lose myself once I start seeing multiple options and want to explore them all.
