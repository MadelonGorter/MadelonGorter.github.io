# Week 5 Reflective Questions

### Knowledge resulting from tinkering
The knowledge resulting from tinkering in my experience is mostly problem solving skills and creativity. You are constantly focussing on how things fit together and can be changed. It also has big impact on being scared to try stuff out, you are constantly doing things and mostly exploring with your hands which removes this anxiety.

### Tinkering with digital and electronic media
Tinkering with digital and electronic media adds some form of interaction since often sensors or microcontrollers are used which are able to provide some form of feedback. It also combines the physical world with the computing world to create something. Coding is also open-ended however there are some rules or syntax which must be used in order to get it working.

### Reproducibility in tinkering 
Reproducing something is often done through using documentation, this is something which can be made but is often about the result. While in tinkering the process is often way more important. You are more focussed on exploring than making something reproducible. When you are tinkering often you end up changing a lot of things around the way and just trying stuff out. When a result of that is documented it does not teach the same lessons. Tinkering is more about adapting as you go than about making something reproducible. 

### Iterative prototyping and tinkering cycles
Tinkering is often open-ended where as prototyping is mostly done with a specific goal in mind. Prototypes are often tested and improved to get the best version. In tinkering the process is the most important and the ability to explore different things. I do think however that it is not black and white and that tinkering and prototyping are often overlapping. 

### Co-design as tinkering session
I think a co-design session can be described as a tinkering session when it has certain features. Most importantly the co-design session must be hands-on, open-ended and exploratory to fit the tinkering principle. Next to that the support/facilitator in a co-design session must be focussed on helping people sharing, trying and also failing. 

### Influence of materials in a co-design session
I think the results can be influenced since there are many types of materials which result in different outcomes. For exmaple using cardboard encourages people to take risks and be really hands-on. If the material provided is less valuable there will be different outcomes compared to using an Arduino kit. The materials can influence the outcomes but do not always control the outcomes since people use them and do the things they want. This can not be predicted up front by choosing a certain type of material. I think the influencing the outcome with the type of materials is nice since people can be pushed into a certain direction to create certain outcomes. Next to that it is also not very nice since you want to give people the ability to choose the direction they want to go in. 

### Tinkering in research through design
I think tinkering in research through design can fill in the design part since it shows people many different options through creating designs. Not only differnt options but also why they do or do not work and how people can interact with them. It helps to solve problems in a hands-on way. 

### Untinkerable design questions
I think there are quite some design questions in which tinkering it not really possible. These situations do not have an open end or use strict rules and regulations also high fidelity with a lot of details is diffucult to achieve with tinkering. I think in these areas it can provide new creative options which are often overlooked but these options sometimes mean that they are unachievable in real life. Next to that questions that use many different materials are also not really feasbile since you are unable to explore them all. Tinkering often gives many ideas and insight but does not give a perfect end-result that solves all. 

### Balancing real-world with the fruitful mindset of tinkering
I think a good combination for this would be to have a sweet spot between exploring and asking yourself questions about the real-world. For exmaple when an idea takes shape to step back put on your critical glasses and ask yourself questions such as What am i learning? What problem does this idea solve? Can this be used in the real world? After answering these questions you can decide to further explore certain ideas or comments to dive deeper. 

### Critical impact of tinkering exercises
A positive critical impact my tinkering exercise could have is that I am able to create and come up with many new ideas while improving my problem-solving skills and working hands-on which can be useful in other parts of my life.

A negative impact can be that ideas might still be vague and not only answer top-level questions without deep diving into the real problems and how to solve them. Next to that the lack of direction can also contribute to this since you are also staying more on the surface. 

### Environmental impact of a session
I think that using reusable and recyclable materials can be necessary to keep down the amount of stuff and ecological footprint a session uses. Another thing can be to disassemble the materials and use them again. I think it is also important to show the people that this aspect is often overlooked and is important to think about and reflect on during and after such a session. A session should be tailored to let people fully explore but it is not always only fun and for this people need to take responsibility about they used.
