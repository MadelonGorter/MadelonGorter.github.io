# Building Block Progress Week 1
The design assignment was to come up with your own design of a construction/building block. Make at least 10 concept drawings or a morphological overview and to keep in mind that next session (so think ahead) the goal is to make a physical prototype of this building block.

For my building block I used sketching as the tinkering method. In the picture you can see the process.
