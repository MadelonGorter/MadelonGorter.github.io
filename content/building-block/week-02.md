# Building Block Progress Week 2

I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems are not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don"t they get on your nerves! I'm still trying to solve the problem and will update the section when it is fixed!
