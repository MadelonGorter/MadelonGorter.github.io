# Scaffolding Exercise

Scaffolding material is something you need to design. Often a metaphor works well as a link between what is known (i.e. stacking building blocks) and what is not known (programming code). This week we would like you to come up with a concept (and prototype) for a physical, tangible metaphor for coding. Think along the lines of Scratch (blockly) where you stack bricks or the game RoboRally where you lay cards in order.

- make sure the idea is tangible , i.e. blocks you can put on a table, beads you can string together, magnets you can stick to something, etc...
- make use of the affordance of a material. Are your users supposed to tear it apart or scribble on it?
- make clear choices which programming concepts (functions, variables, scope, program flow, input / output / classes / inheritance) you implement (or focus on)
