# Parts list
The coat assistant was originally built at home without keeping a detailed list of the parts used. To address this, a parts list was made based on the design of the coat assistant. This list provides a clear overview of all the parts used in the coat assistant. With this list the coat assistant becomes more reproducible since people are now able to identify and purchase the parts needed to build their own. To improve the accessibility, the list includes links to manufacturers, costs and technical details. The complete list is found in Appendix 1 with an explanation of the list in Appendix 2. 

The coat assistant has a lot of different parts ranging from the aluminium frame to a small bolt. To create a better understanding of which part executes which function, five main components have been identified. The coat assistant is split into the neck clamp, sleeve clamp, frame, lift and footrest. 

In the parts list the cost of the individual parts can be found. The total price of the parts for the coat assistant is estimated around 1100 euros, this excludes the man hours of building the coat assistant. Making the list took around two days and is an essential part in making the coat assistant accessible. It not only improves understanding of each part's role but also simplifies troubleshooting and maintenance.
