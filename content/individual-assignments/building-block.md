# Building Block Progress Week 1
The design assignment was to come up with your own design of a construction/building block. Make at least 10 concept drawings or a morphological overview and to keep in mind that next session (so think ahead) the goal is to make a physical prototype of this building block.

For my building block I used sketching as the tinkering method. In the picture you can see the process.

# Building Block Progress Week 2

I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems are not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don't they get on your nerves! The problem was not solveable within this course so I went to Designlab to get it printed. Below you can see the results!
