Workspace
Below you can find a picture of my own workspace!


In my workspace I have a lot of different materials and tools which I am able to use, these are:

3D printer
Wood tools
Sander
Hammer
Screwdrivers
Pliers
Lego
Sewing kit
Arduino kit
Electronic parts
Laptop
Sketchbooks
Pencils
Markers
Paint
Brushes

I tinker the most in the Design domain more specific in the electronics and 3D printing domains. In these domains the tinkering helps to create prototypes and also iterate these prototypes to see in what ways a prototype can be made and what can be changed. After that the tinkering helps to combine all of these prototypes into one main idea.">

<h2 id="reflective-questions">Reflective Questions<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#reflective-questions">#</a></h2>
<h3 id="question-1"><strong>Question 1</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-1">#</a></h3>
<p>Definitions according to the Cambridge Dictionary [1]</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinkering: to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it</li>
<li>Trial-and-error: a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make</li>
<li>Brainstorming: an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development</li>
</ul>
<p>All three have to do with improving or solving a problem
Improving an existing product or coming up with a new product
Ways of creating new ideas and products</p>
<p>The definition of tinkering from the dictionary has more to do with making changes to something that exists while the definition in the course is more about using materials to epxlore options. To explore options also small changes can be made. The dictionary definition is directed at a goal to repair or improve something but the course definition does not start with a goal. Exploring options is most often also done in small steps so in that way they match.</p>
<p>AI tool [2]
Definition</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinkering: This is an open-ended, hands-on approach to learning and problem-solving. It involves experimenting with materials and ideas through playful exploration, allowing for creativity and personal expression. Tinkering encourages individuals to identify problems and work on solving them in creative ways, often without a predetermined outcome.</li>
<li>Trial-and-Error: This method involves attempting various solutions to a problem until finding one that works. It&rsquo;s a process of making repeated, varied attempts, learning from mistakes, and gradually approaching a desired result. This approach is fundamental in learning and problem-solving, emphasizing persistence and adaptation.</li>
<li>Brainstorming: A creative technique where individuals or groups generate a multitude of ideas to address a specific issue or challenge. This method encourages open thinking and the free flow of ideas, promoting innovative solutions and collaboration.</li>
</ul>
<p>Comparison:</p>
<p>Approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinkering: Hands-on, experimental, and iterative, focusing on exploration and making.</li>
<li>Trial-and-Error: Systematic testing of various solutions until success is achieved.</li>
<li>Brainstorming: Idea generation through discussion, without immediate evaluation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Outcome:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinkering: May lead to unexpected discoveries or innovations.</li>
<li>Trial-and-Error: Aims to find a working solution through elimination.</li>
<li>Brainstorming: Produces a broad range of ideas for potential solutions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Tinkering: Involves playful interaction with materials and concepts.</li>
<li>Trial-and-Error: Involves testing and learning from failures.</li>
<li>Brainstorming: Involves collaborative ideation</li>
</ul>
<p>Does the Course Definition Match the Dictionary Definition?
Yes, but with more depth! The course definition aligns with the dictionary definition of tinkering in that both emphasize hands-on, exploratory, and iterative approaches.</p>
<p>Key Difference: The course definition is more structured in its description of the tinkering process, emphasizing:</p>
<ul>
<li>The progression from undirected play to goal-driven experimentation.</li>
<li>The role of trial-and-error as a fundamental method.</li>
<li>The influence of serendipity rather than strict structure.</li>
</ul>
<p>What aspects does the answer miss?
The AI definition does not state that tinkering can also be done with a goal in mind. The AI definition also misses the broad settings in which Tinkering can be used. The AI states it as an approach to learn and problem solve while the course talks about it being a mindset.</p>
<h3 id="question-2"><strong>Question 2</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-2">#</a></h3>
<p>The project I have chosen is the Smirnoff - Mindtunes project [3] in which they use Brain Computer Interfacing to make music. This is done to give people who are tetraplegic the opportunity to be creative and make music together using only their brains. They transform emotion into brainwaves and then into sounds waves to make a song together.</p>
<p>The 5 technical hurdles the project faced are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sensor accuracy</li>
<li>Controlling thoughts</li>
<li>Connecting all three persons to different instruments with their emotions controlling different parts of the music</li>
<li>Noise in the BCI data</li>
<li>Calibrating to each individual</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="question-3"><strong>Question 3</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-3">#</a></h3>
<p>I would go hunting for tinkerspiration at these physical and online places:</p>
<p>Physical:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ability Tech</li>
<li>FabLabs</li>
<li>Makerspaces</li>
<li>Designlab</li>
<li>Museums</li>
</ol>
<p>Online:</p>
<ol>
<li>Thingiverse</li>
<li>Instructables</li>
<li>Instagram</li>
<li>YouTube</li>
<li>Arduino Project Hub</li>
</ol>
<p>I have gotten inspiration from a lot of YouTube videos and made projects which were available on Thingiverse. I have found multiple project on Thingiverse which are still on my bucket list and to be made list. For example completing the InMoov [4] robot which can be seen in the image below.</p>
<p><img alt="InMoov robot" loading="lazy" src="/img/InMoov.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="question-4"><strong>Question 4</strong><a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#question-4">#</a></h3>
<p>The 5 domains, challenges or setting I would like to apply tinkering in are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Assitive technology</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why? Designing accessible personalized products for people with a disability. It is a way of coming up with small ideas that can improve the daily life of a person with a disability dramatically. For example a 3D printed part which can hold down greens on the counter for a person which is able to use one hand.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>Music</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why? To create alternative ways to create music. For example the Smirnoff mindtunes, so giving someone who is not able to hold a physical instrument the change to still play music.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>Public transport</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why? Public transport is constantly searching for improvements but the tracks are not easy to change so tinkering can mean something for the world around the tracks. For example changing the inside of a train with ambient lights or different seating options that create a welcoming and nice feeling and next to that to create interactive things at the stations waiting rooms.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="4">
<li>Student housing</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why? Tinkering could be used to see what students would come up with for their own house and thus tailor a house to their needs. Since they are students they might come up with crazy ideas for which they are able to test them themselves since they often do research. For example a ideas to creative ideas to create more spacee in a small room.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>Mental health</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Why? People can come up with everything they want which can work therapeutic since a person is able to let go off all their thoughts and stress because they focus on doing something with their hands. For example for a person with autism to make something that expresses their emotions.</li>
</ul>
<p>The sweetspots are in domains where a person is able to constantly change and thus iterate on ideas. I don&rsquo;t think there are untinkerable domains since it can always give ideas but in the medicine world it would be dangerous to use medicines that have not been tested. So it is also important that there are no risks or certain restrictions to tinkering in a domain.</p>
