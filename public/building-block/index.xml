&lt;p&gt;I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems are not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don&amp;rsquo;t they get on your nerves! The problem was not solveable within this course so I went to Designlab to get it printed. Below you can see the results!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;The design assignment was to come up with your own design of a construction/building block. Make at least 10 concept drawings or a morphological overview and to keep in mind that next session (so think ahead) the goal is to make a physical prototype of this building block.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For my building block I used sketching as the tinkering method. In the picture you can see the process.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
