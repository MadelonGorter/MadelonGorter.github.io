<p>We started the assignment by doing a little brainstorm in which we came up with ideas that were closed to our interests. From our first selection of problems, we picked the unintuitiveness of cars; how hard it is to know what is wrong with one without training and/or extensive documentation / help. Rationale; tinkering mindset to make something technically difficult accessible.</p>
<p>During the brainstorm we made some sketches on a whiteboard
<img alt="Brainstorm" loading="lazy" src="/img/Brainstorm.jpg"></p>
<p>The two ideas that came from the brainstorm were:</p>
<ol>
<li>Education kit for cars</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Many people, especially children, grow up without a basic understanding of how car engines work, making regular car maintenance and unexpected roadside issues difficult to handle. The solution: A kit that you can give to children (or adults) that gives them an intuition for the parts present in a car.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="2">
<li>VR kit</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>A VR kit that shows people what they can find under the hood of a car.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="pitches">Pitches<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#pitches">#</a></h3>
<p>We pitched these two ideas and received feedback about the feasibility of the ideas. The mindset and type of idea was really fitting for a tinkering session. However, since making these ideas would mean that we would go big which would be difficult to make in real-life. We got a tip to look more into the Invento kits since it would be building materials that have the same scale as our ideas. We could use this as part of our scaffolding materials which would be given out during our tinkering session. Next to that we received the feedback that our workshop was too little open-ended and would turn more into a teaching session instead of a tinkering one.</p>
<p>After the pitches we increased our tinkerability through refining our scope to the concept of energy transformation specifically a combustion engine which translates pressure into movement. We wanted to let kids explore the concept of pressure and to turn it into motion and/or direction.
The general goal was to let people explore mechanical mechanisms. One the ideas was to give two (or more) translating motors and some other materials to people for a workshop. The goal is to turn the translating movement into a rotating movement and do something cool with it (among the materials will be wheels, propellers and other cool rotating stuff).</p>
<p>Our main technical hurdle in this phase was the difficulty of creating an actually working piston + crankshaft system. Our building block would be this component, and through a life-size scale this building block would have an inviting affordance, allowing participants to transform muscle force to pressure to movement. A wide range of other components would be supplied so that participants could then use this movement to create whatever they deemed cool.</p>

<p>We used this idea and pitched it again, after reflecting we realised that, though the idea was nice. The building blocks we had thought up would be very hard to realise within the scope of this course. So we made another switch, this time not necessarily for tinkerability&rsquo;s sake, but so that the concept would become something we could realise. We kept the theme of energy transfer but made it more feasible by switching from pistons to sails. We chose this idea since most of our group members have experience with windsurfing and know how the wind is transformed into movement. Next to that most of have handy materials laying around or access to surfing materials so ideas could easily be realised. In addition, this idea requires less precision in the materials used, pistons need to be airtight for example. This meant that prototyping was more forgiving and easy to make different models. A downside to this idea is that the workshop is difficult to do without the wind and thus very reliant on the wind conditions.</p>
<h3 id="session-design-work">Session Design Work<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#session-design-work">#</a></h3>
<p>After thinking out the idea we tried making a division between pre-designed parts and what to leave to be tinkered with. the first idea was to make a pre-made sail which we give to the people as building block. They were able to make their own surfboard or boat or skateboard on which the sail can be attached. This again meant that the workshop was not really open-ended that is why we changed to a different building block. We tried making it open-ended through letting people build their own sail and surfboard/skateboard in the workshop. People are able to create many different sail types and boards which can be used to translate wind into motion. People can choose between making something that can be used on land and in water. People should be able to do whatever they want to do with the materials we provide to harness the wind. However we do want to provide some building blocks which make it easier to build a sail.</p>
<p>These building blocks make sure users can quickly and easily carry out their ideas in a physical way. The blocks take care of that the sail cloth can be easily attached to a mast, a mast can be easily mounted to their board and that a sail frame can be made. We thus need to design connectors for attaching rods/masts to each other and the structure and a way to easily attach sail cloth to those rods</p>
<h3 id="prototyping">Prototyping<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#prototyping">#</a></h3>
<p>We started designing and making preliminary design for the three building blocks. As first step we chose a PVC pipe from designlab which we were going to be using for the rods.</p>
<p>There are three different types of building blocks with each different iteration cycles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Sail cloth connector</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is used to connect the sail cloth to the rods
The sail cloth that we used are old surfing kites which were broken and were otherwise thrown in the bin. We used them since they are lightweight, reasonably sturdy and accessible to us. To connect the cloth to the rods we had multiple iterations.</li>
</ul>
<p>In version 1 we used old rubber bicycle handlebars, we cut them open and fitted them around the rod to which the sail was connected. Since it is made out of rubber it was very grippy on the sail. It worked okay ish but since the rubber was flexible the connector came of way too easily when pressure was used. In version 2 we used a corrugation tube which makes it a bit too unflexible to easily clip on but makes for a more snug fit. The material of the tubes hard/smooth so there was not enough grip, that is when we decided to make our own sail cloth connector with a 3d printer.</p>

      </tr>
  </tbody>

<p>After printing and changing dimensions ten times we got a clip that was snapping onto the pipe and not coming of too easily. Next to the sailclip we tried making a clip that could be tie down with a rope.</p>

<p>The first idea was to make the rod connectors flexible so they could be easily bended and make the frame of the sail. After sketching out some ideas we tried modelling and 3d printing them to see if they would work. The clips on the left have a rope which make sure you can tie down the rod so they will not go off easily. However when modelling the sketch we came to the conclusion that when you connect the rods in the connectors they would be aligned horizontally, this does not help making a shape for a sail. The rods needs to be connected in different angles and lining up horizontally to create a shape. To connect the rods in the most simple way in an angle we made the second sketch in a model. Since the dimensions of the rod were known it was easy to create and 3d print this shape. It worked nicely but the downside to this model is that the angle is not able to rotate and the connector needs to be slided onto the frame. This creates restrictions in easily creating different shapes. After that we tried 3d printing with TPU but this could not be done with the 3d printed available to one of the group members. We still wanted to create a connector that had different angles.</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Rod connector models</th>
          <th></th>
          <th></th>

          <td><img alt="Rod connector " loading="lazy" src="/img/Rod-connector.jpeg"></td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p>That is why we tried to use a model closely related to the sail cloth clip. This model has some requirements namely to change the angle and connecting the rods in any place. After sketching, an idea came up and this idea was 3d printed. The idea was to make two differnt parts which had magnets attached. One part is a bigger version of the sail clip and the other is a block which can be changed to a block that has different angels. This makes it easy to connect them in different angels and change things up when needed. When testing the prototype it became clear that when force was applied the magnets would not be strong enough to keep the two parts together and thus create a frame for the sail. In the next steps we only used the rigid 90 degree angle connector.</p>

<p>During the testing of our workshop and gathering material we cam across multiple difficulties. One of the difficulties was that when searching for more rods it became clear that we had chosen a PVC pipe which was not a standard dimension. After going to a lot of different stores we chose a standard dimension and added foam around it so the clips that were made were still able to fit around the pipe tightly. This made the pipes less rigid, but we were able to use the same clips without needing to print new ones. Also an advantage was that now the dimensions were not that strict so we were able to use all of the prototypes of the clips and did not needed to print more.</p>

<ol start="3">
<li>Baseplate</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Is used to connect the mast with the board
For the baseplate multiple sketches and a model were made. However, when getting the rods it became clear that the baseplate was not needed anymore. The existing windsurfing baseplates were able to fit perfectly into the rods and it thus became redundant.</li>
</ul>
<p>To connect the rods with the baseplate more sturdy we added holes to the pipes so they can be attached to mast feet with a piece of rope. We made sketches for creating different baseplates to connect to different boards but during the testing we used a mountainboard board which has a baseplate and we did not worked this out further.</p>
<p>Next to the prototypes we made cards which we can show to people to give them idea about what type of sail to build. Pictures of these cards can be found on the poster.</p>
<p>For the testing we brought a lot of old kites, scissors, knives and ropes so people were able to make their own sail. We tested with group member who did not have knowledge about sail and she was able to build her own sail according to the idea she had. It worked out nicely and made more sails during the demo day. Below an overview of the sail that were made can be found.</p>
