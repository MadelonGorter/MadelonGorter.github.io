You are constantly focussing on how things fit together and can be changed. It also has big impact on being scared to try stuff out, you are constantly doing things and mostly exploring with your hands which removes this anxiety.\nTinkering with digital and electronic media Tinkering with digital and electronic media adds some form of interaction since often sensors or microcontrollers are used which are able to provide some form of feedback. It also combines the physical world with the computing world to create something. Coding is also open-ended however there are some rules or syntax which must be used in order to get it working.\nReproducibility in tinkering Reproducing something is often done through using documentation, this is something which can be made but is often about the result. While in tinkering the process is often way more important. You are more focussed on exploring than making something reproducible. When you are tinkering often you end up changing a lot of things around the way and just trying stuff out. When a result of that is documented it does not teach the same lessons. Tinkering is more about adapting as you go than about making something reproducible.\nIterative prototyping and tinkering cycles Tinkering is often open-ended where as prototyping is mostly done with a specific goal in mind. Prototypes are often tested and improved to get the best version. In tinkering the process is the most important and the ability to explore different things. I do think however that it is not black and white and that tinkering and prototyping are often overlapping.\nCo-design as tinkering session I think a co-design session can be described as a tinkering session when it has certain features. Most importantly the co-design session must be hands-on, open-ended and exploratory to fit the tinkering principle. Next to that the support/facilitator in a co-design session must be focussed on helping people sharing, trying and also failing.\nInfluence of materials in a co-design session I think the results can be influenced since there are many types of materials which result in different outcomes. For exmaple using cardboard encourages people to take risks and be really hands-on. If the material provided is less valuable there will be different outcomes compared to using an Arduino kit. The materials can influence the outcomes but do not always control the outcomes since people use them and do the things they want. This can not be predicted up front by choosing a certain type of material. I think the influencing the outcome with the type of materials is nice since people can be pushed into a certain direction to create certain outcomes. Next to that it is also not very nice since you want to give people the ability to choose the direction they want to go in.\nTinkering in research through design I think tinkering in research through design can fill in the design part since it shows people many different options through creating designs. Not only differnt options but also why they do or do not work and how people can interact with them. It helps to solve problems in a hands-on way.\nUntinkerable design questions I think there are quite some design questions in which tinkering it not really possible. These situations do not have an open end or use strict rules and regulations also high fidelity with a lot of details is diffucult to achieve with tinkering. I think in these areas it can provide new creative options which are often overlooked but these options sometimes mean that they are unachievable in real life. Next to that questions that use many different materials are also not really feasbile since you are unable to explore them all. Tinkering often gives many ideas and insight but does not give a perfect end-result that solves all.\nBalancing real-world with the fruitful mindset of tinkering I think a good combination for this would be to have a sweet spot between exploring and asking yourself questions about the real-world. For exmaple when an idea takes shape to step back put on your critical glasses and ask yourself questions such as What am i learning? What problem does this idea solve? Can this be used in the real world? After answering these questions you can decide to further explore certain ideas or comments to dive deeper.\nCritical impact of tinkering exercises A positive critical impact my tinkering exercise could have is that I am able to create and come up with many new ideas while improving my problem-solving skills and working hands-on which can be useful in other parts of my life.\nA negative impact can be that ideas might still be vague and not only answer top-level questions without deep diving into the real problems and how to solve them. Next to that the lack of direction can also contribute to this since you are also staying more on the surface.\nEnvironmental impact of a session I think that using reusable and recyclable materials can be necessary to keep down the amount of stuff and ecological footprint a session uses. Another thing can be to disassemble the materials and use them again. I think it is also important to show the people that this aspect is often overlooked and is important to think about and reflect on during and after such a session. A session should be tailored to let people fully explore but it is not always only fun and for this people need to take responsibility about they used.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/05-design-work-critical-making/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-5-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 5 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"knowledge-resulting-from-tinkering\"\u003eKnowledge resulting from tinkering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge resulting from tinkering in my experience is mostly problem solving skills and creativity.

Often a metaphor works well as a link between what is known (i.e. stacking building blocks) and what is not known (programming code). This week we would like you to come up with a concept (and prototype) for a physical, tangible metaphor for coding. Think along the lines of Scratch (blockly) where you stack bricks or the game RoboRally where you lay cards in order.\nmake sure the idea is tangible , i.e. blocks you can put on a table, beads you can string together, magnets you can stick to something, etc\u0026hellip; make use of the affordance of a material.

Children are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO. Adults might need more encouragement to start, be creative and keep going assuring them that they can not do something wrong. Adults have not played in a long time so some start up time shoiuld also be kept in mind.\nRelevant Concepts Hands-on: using your hands to express your thoughts Metaphors: expressing ideas with metaphors that can be found in the LEGO Sharing \u0026amp; Safety: making sure people speak up and listen to what others say in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Teaching: Papert \u0026amp; Montessori From the Invent to Learn book chapter 5 multiple key principles by Papert and Montessori can be identified.\nThe Key Principles of Papert Constructionism: Learning happens when people are actively making something they care about. Learning through tinkering: Using a hands-on, trial-and-error approach to learning. Children should experiment, build, and refine their ideas through iterative design cycles Powerful ideas and microworlds: Learning should be about powerful ideas, concept that have lasting significance and can be applied in multiple contexts. While using microworlds, self-contained digital environments where learners could experiment with complex concepts in a simplified setting Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls: design learning environments that have a Low floor: easy to get started High ceiling: allowing for deep and complex explorations Wide walls: encouraging creativity Personal curricula: Education should be based on self-directed exploration, teachers encourage tinkering and learning together The role of computers: Using computers to extend cognitive abilities The Key Principles of Montessori Hands-on learning: Learning through direct, physical interaction with materials Prepared environment: Design classrooms to promote independent learning, every material has specific purpose Intrinsic motivation and self directed learning: Children learn best when they follow their own curiosity, use materials that are self-correcting so children discover their mistakes on their own. Freedom within limits: Children should have the freedom to choose their activities but within a carefully structured environment Mixed-age classrooms and peer learning Observation and adaption: Teachers act as guides, they step back and let children explore while intervening only when necessary Overlap Between Papert and Montessori Papert and Montessori both emphazise on active and hands-on learning and giving the children the space to decide what they want to learn. They encourage children to learn through doing and experimenting while keeping the level of instruction at the minimum. Children are encouraged to make mistakes and follor their own paths.\nDifference Between Papert and Montessori Paper and Montessori also have differences in their approach with the most prominent one being the use of technology. Papert uses computers as learning devices while Montessori prefers physical and meaningfull materials. They also differ in their way of structuring the environment around the children, Papert uses an open-ended and more explorative environment while Montessori uses a prepared environment in which children can do things within the boundaries of the environment. Lastly, Papert and Montessori also differ in their view of the role of a teacher. Papert mostly lets the teachers encourage the children to learn together and tinker while Montessori put the role as a teacher more as a guide which only intervene when necessary.\nTinkering for Children of Different Ages For young children aged 3 to 6 both of the mantra are valuable since they encourage children to explore through a hands-on approach using different materials. When a child gets older (6-12 years) Papert introduces the use of computers which opens up a whole new world of problems to solve. While Montessori still uses the same materials but with more difficult problems. Teenagers in the Papert approach use even more programming while Montessori mostly focusses on for example applications of math. Montessori has great principles which work well for young children while Papert using the computers has more relevant principles for children growing up, especially in a world where digital tools are becoming more and more important. Combining hands-on learning with physical materials with digital problem solving sounds like a future proof approach to education.\nShaping the Learning Environment Useful Pointers Space and Setting for Tinkering From the Invent to Learn book chapter 9 multiple pointers are named, these useful pointers include:\nFlexible \u0026amp; Adaptable Documentation Accessible Tools \u0026amp; Materials Culture of Experimentation The message given is that learning spaces should intentionally be designed to foster creativity, agency and self-directed exploration. Makerspaces are not just about a place to use tools and materials but are about setting a mindset where poeple see themselves as inventors and problem-solvers.\nNecessity of a Designlab/Fablab A designlab/fablab is not needed since the mindset about making and being an inventor can be used everywhere. The most important things are that the environment supports creativity and exploration.\nPractice as a Designer/Engineer Using Tinkering I use Tinkering in the ideation and prototyping phase of a project. In the ideation phase I use it to generate multiple ideas. In the prototyping phase I mostly use it to explore different features and test the prototypes.\nTranslating Design and Research Problems into a Tinkering Playground A design or research problem can be translated into a tinkering playground through breaking it into smaller parts which can be solved by using open-ended materials. After solving the smaller parts it can be combined to solve the bigger problem.\nGetting Unstuck Things to use when you get stuck are to use different materials then the ones currently used and also looking in the world around you to see how the problem can be seen in other ways so looking for an analogous solution. It can also be useful to involve others in your tinkering process to get different perspectives and solutions and work around the part were you are stuck at. Another option is to stop and go for a walk to give your brain some rest and focus on other things.\nGetting in the Flow To get in the flow I make sure that people are not able to distract me and that there are a lot of different materials present. I feel like just starting and doing random stuff also helps to start the ideas. I mostly start sketching or making stuff with 3d modelling or LEGO blocks to see which options can be found. After the first options are there you can explore one of the options or generate more options. I can completely lose myself once I start seeing multiple options and want to explore them all.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/03-facilitation2/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-3-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 3 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lego-serious-play\"\u003eLEGO Serious Play\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"role-of-adults-in-facilitation\"\u003eRole of Adults in Facilitation?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChildren are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO.

I looked into the concept of Affordance and searched for all the different materials online to make the material table. The table can be found on the material table tab.\nThe concept of affordance is used to give a better understanding about what makes materials good for tinkering. The concept of affordance can be viewed from two perspectives, namely Gibson and Norman. Gibson is focussed on the ecological psychology [1] and Norman used the human-computer interaction (HCI) framework [2].\nGibson in 1977 defined affordance as \u0026ldquo;offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill\u0026rdquo; [3] So in other words it refers to all action possibilities with an object based on user\u0026rsquo;s physical capabilities [4].\nIn 1988 Norman introduces the concept of affordance to the design community and changed the definition a bit so it could be easier used for designers [4]. He defined it as \u0026ldquo;perceivable action possibilities\u0026rdquo; in other words only actions which users consider possible. Designer must keep affordances in mind when designing product or services since elements of their design suggest how user can use their product or services.\nConnecting the concept of affordance to tinkering materials shows us that the materials that have clear affordances help people tinker. They invite people to start exploring and use the materials in different ways. Materials that suggest that they can be used in multiple ways encourage creativity, learning and experimentation.\nFrom the chapter \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; it also becomes clear that they emphaze to create an environment and tools that support open-ended exploration and invention. Their view on making designs that are intuitive and invite interaction closely relate to Norman and his view on the perceived affordances. Through the use of materials and tools that suggest their functionalities, a tinkering mindset is encouraged.\nCombining all of the frameworks and opinions this means that in tinkering, materials that have multiple functionalities and that suggest their possibilities need to be designed or used to encourage exploration. This helps people to know what we can do with things just by looking or touching them [4].\nReferences\n[1] https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Jerome_Gibson [2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Norman [3] https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/book/the-encyclopedia-of-human-computer-interaction-2nd-ed/affordances [4] https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances?srsltid=AfmBOooyyHbb4hAxYGnsQC-uMnSeRPMCW6BzSUH4_u_TX9kw_tW2scZv ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/02-hands-on/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-2-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 2 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI was not physically present during session two and received some information from peers but that was not very useful.

the material table I chose the criteria of self guiding, preciousness, skills needs, interoperability, seeing the process and seeing the results. I chose these criteria since I felt like they support creativity, exploration and learning by doing. The criteria appeared in the \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; chapter and in affordances by Norman. My definitions of the criteria are:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Material Table"},{"content":"Week 1 Reflective Questions About Page You can now find information about me in the about tab!\nWorkspace Below you can find a picture of my own workspace! In my workspace I have a lot of different materials and tools which I am able to use, these are:\n3D printer Wood tools Sander Hammer Screwdrivers Pliers Lego Sewing kit Arduino kit Electronic parts Laptop Sketchbooks Pencils Markers Paint Brushes I tinker the most in the Design domain more specific in the electronics and 3D printing domains. In these domains the tinkering helps to create prototypes and also iterate these prototypes to see in what ways a prototype can be made and what can be changed. After that the tinkering helps to combine all of these prototypes into one main idea.\nTo get away from my screen I like to take pictures and make drawings.\nI have a lot of item on my wishlist but the main ones are to have a 3D printer that is able to print TPU and a soldering station.\nReflective Questions Question 1 Tinkering is widely associated with trial-and-error and brainstorming. Find dictionary definitions of the three techniques, and compare them. Does the definition of tinkering match the definition we have in the course? Also, ask a generative AI tool for the definitions and differences. Which aspects does the answer provided miss?\nDefinitions according to the Cambridge Dictionary [1]\nTinkering: to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it Trial-and-error: a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make Brainstorming: an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development All three have to do with improving or solving a problem Improving an existing product or coming up with a new product Ways of creating new ideas and products\nThe definition of tinkering from the dictionary has more to do with making changes to something that exists while the definition in the course is more about using materials to epxlore options. To explore options also small changes can be made. The dictionary definition is directed at a goal to repair or improve something but the course definition does not start with a goal. Exploring options is most often also done in small steps so in that way they match.\nAI tool [2] Definition\nTinkering: This is an open-ended, hands-on approach to learning and problem-solving. It involves experimenting with materials and ideas through playful exploration, allowing for creativity and personal expression. Tinkering encourages individuals to identify problems and work on solving them in creative ways, often without a predetermined outcome. Trial-and-Error: This method involves attempting various solutions to a problem until finding one that works. It\u0026rsquo;s a process of making repeated, varied attempts, learning from mistakes, and gradually approaching a desired result. This approach is fundamental in learning and problem-solving, emphasizing persistence and adaptation. Brainstorming: A creative technique where individuals or groups generate a multitude of ideas to address a specific issue or challenge. This method encourages open thinking and the free flow of ideas, promoting innovative solutions and collaboration. Comparison:\nApproach:\nTinkering: Hands-on, experimental, and iterative, focusing on exploration and making. Trial-and-Error: Systematic testing of various solutions until success is achieved. Brainstorming: Idea generation through discussion, without immediate evaluation. Outcome:\nTinkering: May lead to unexpected discoveries or innovations. Trial-and-Error: Aims to find a working solution through elimination. Brainstorming: Produces a broad range of ideas for potential solutions. Process:\nTinkering: Involves playful interaction with materials and concepts. Trial-and-Error: Involves testing and learning from failures. Brainstorming: Involves collaborative ideation Does the Course Definition Match the Dictionary Definition? Yes, but with more depth! The course definition aligns with the dictionary definition of tinkering in that both emphasize hands-on, exploratory, and iterative approaches.\nKey Difference: The course definition is more structured in its description of the tinkering process, emphasizing:\nThe progression from undirected play to goal-driven experimentation. The role of trial-and-error as a fundamental method. The influence of serendipity rather than strict structure. What aspects does the answer miss? The AI definition does not state that tinkering can also be done with a goal in mind. The AI definition also misses the broad settings in which Tinkering can be used. The AI states it as an approach to learn and problem solve while the course talks about it being a mindset.\nQuestion 2 Can you take a typical I-Tech related project case, list and explain 5 technical hurdles? To which extent do they allow for a \u0026lsquo;playful\u0026rsquo; approach in tackling them? Please give arguments.\nThe project I have chosen is the Smirnoff - Mindtunes project [3] in which they use Brain Computer Interfacing to make music. This is done to give people who are tetraplegic the opportunity to be creative and make music together using only their brains. They transform emotion into brainwaves and then into sounds waves to make a song together.\nThe 5 technical hurdles the project faced are:\nSensor accuracy Controlling thoughts Connecting all three persons to different instruments with their emotions controlling different parts of the music Noise in the BCI data Calibrating to each individual Question 3 Where would you go hunting for tinkerspiration? List 5 physical and 5 online resources valuable for an I-Tech specialist. In which did you already find inspiration for a project you did or that got on your bucket list?\nPhysical:\nAbility Tech FabLabs Makerspaces Designlab Museums Online:\nThingiverse Instructables Instagram YouTube Arduino Project Hub I have gotten inspiration from a lot of YouTube videos and made projects which were available on Thingiverse. I have found multiple project on Thingiverse which are still on my bucket list and to be made list. For example completing the InMoov [4] robot which can be seen in the image below.\nQuestion 4 List 5 domains, challenges or settings in which you would like to apply tinkering, and explain why. Can you identify some sweet spots, (perhaps beyond the well-known such as STEM education) and can you also define some limitations? Are there \u0026lsquo;untinkerable\u0026rsquo; domains?\nThe 5 domains, challenges or setting I would like to apply tinkering in are:\nAssitive technology Why? Designing accessible personalized products for people with a disability. It is a way of coming up with small ideas that can improve the daily life of a person with a disability dramatically. For example a 3D printed part which can hold down greens on the counter for a person which is able to use one hand. Music Why? To create alternative ways to create music. For example the Smirnoff mindtunes, so giving someone who is not able to hold a physical instrument the change to still play music. Public transport Why? Public transport is constantly searching for improvements but the tracks are not easy to change so tinkering can mean something for the world around the tracks. For example changing the inside of a train with ambient lights or different seating options that create a welcoming and nice feeling and next to that to create interactive things at the stations waiting rooms. Student housing Why? Tinkering could be used to see what students would come up with for their own house and thus tailor a house to their needs. Since they are students they might come up with crazy ideas for which they are able to test them themselves since they often do research. For example a ideas to creative ideas to create more spacee in a small room. Mental health Why? People can come up with everything they want which can work therapeutic since a person is able to let go off all their thoughts and stress because they focus on doing something with their hands. For example for a person with autism to make something that expresses their emotions. The sweetspots are in domains where a person is able to constantly change and thus iterate on ideas. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are untinkerable domains since it can always give ideas but in the medicine world it would be dangerous to use medicines that have not been tested. So it is also important that there are no risks or certain restrictions to tinkering in a domain.\nReferences\n[1] https://dictionary.cambridge.org/ [2] https://chatgpt.com/ [3] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r7Nw41vNLUg [4] https://inmoov.fr/ ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/assignments/01-getting_started/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-1-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 1 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"about-page\"\u003eAbout Page\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eYou can now find information about me in the about tab!\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"workspace\"\u003eWorkspace\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBelow you can find a picture of my own workspace!\n\u003cimg alt=\"Workspace desk\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/Bureau.JPEG\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cimg alt=\"Workspace storage\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/img/Kast.JPEG\"\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn my workspace I have a lot of different materials and tools which I am able to use, these are:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003e3D printer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eWood tools\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSander\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eHammer\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eScrewdrivers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePliers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLego\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSewing kit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eArduino kit\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eElectronic parts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eLaptop\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSketchbooks\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePencils\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eMarkers\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003ePaint\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eBrushes\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eI tinker the most in the Design domain more specific in the electronics and 3D printing domains.
