[{"content":"Embodied Agents vs Virtual Agents The discussion on embodied agents vs virtual agens is still relevant since embodiment is still has a big influence on interaction with humans. It creates a physical appearance which people trust and gets attention. Other shapes that exist are HoloLens and Meta Quest which are avatars that move in the space around us but do not have a physical body. Next to that AR/VR and holograms are rising in which virtual agents are projected into the physical world.\nRobotic Capabilities and Social Aspects Robotic capabilities and social aspects are not the same since they differ in focus. Robotic/engineering capabilities focusses on what the robot is able to do and how the robot executes the functions while social aspects is more focussed on how the robot comes across to humans. Social aspects is more focussed on interaction while the focus of robotic capabilities is on performance.\nInsights on dealing in a structured way with the robotic capabilities and social aspects of the design are:\nThe Function–Behavior–Structure (FBS) Framework from J. S. Gero and U. Kannengiesser [1], can help to create a division between functions, behaviors and structures to map social goals to design features. The Interaction Design Framework from J. Forlizzi and S. Ford [2], can help understand and design user experiences in interactive systems. It shows three perspective on experiences and components influencing the experience. Through looking at the components influencing the experience we can make a division between different part in social robot design. The components are product characteristics, user characteristics and interaction context. Next to the components there are also qualities of experience which are stated: satisfying, enjoyable, engaging and meaningful. By understanding the relationship between product attributes, user characteristics and context, designers can predict and influence the quality of the user experience. Yes, we can write social interaction requirements for robots in a clear and organized way, just like we do for technical or engineering tasks. This helps make social behaviors easier to understand, measure and test even though they often feel unclear or hard to define.\nA template for these requirements made with chatgpt [3] can be found below.\nRequirement ID Type Description Criteria for Success Method of Verification SI-001 Social Responsiveness Robot must greet a person within 2 seconds of face detection Time ≤ 2 sec after detection Interaction log, real-time testing SI-002 Emotion Expression Robot must express “confusion” when it fails to understand a command Visual cue (tilted head), audio cue Observation Examples of Conflicts and Opportunities Examples of conflicts that arise in the function defines form vs social requirements are:\nAssistive robot for elderly care: from the functional side it must be very functional and usable while on the social side it needs to look approachable and provide a comforting feel for an elderly. The conflict is in creating a purely functional device will not work for elderly since they will not trust it. Industrial robot arm: from the functional side it must be very efficient, precise and work with speed while on the social side it needs to appear safe and that people can approach the robot and do not need to keep a very big distance. The conflict is mostly in that fast and powerful movements of the arm can seem unsafe and threatening for people that need to work with them. Example of a design that is a very good match is a soft robotic in therapy for example the Paro Robot Seal. In this way the soft and cuddly appearance of the seal supports the function of it providing emotional suport and social bonding. Next to that the movement is slow and gentle which aligns the function of emotional support with the social need of comfort and trust.\nDuffy\u0026rsquo;s Embodiment Reference Duffy (see below) formulated a nice reference list of aspects relevant for design of embodiment. Which of these are the most relevant for your case?\nThe most relevant aspects for design of embodiment according to Duffy are [4]:\nPrinciple Explanation Use social conventions and communication in function and form Design robots to communicate in ways familiar to humans, both in appearance and behavior. Avoid the uncanny valley Steer clear of designs that look almost but not quite human, which can cause discomfort or eeriness. Use natural (fluent) motion Ensure robot movements are smooth and lifelike to foster better social engagement. Balance function and form Make sure the robot’s appearance aligns with and supports its functional goals. Balance anthropomorphism and function Use human-like features thoughtfully to enhance interaction without compromising utility. Allow the robot to portray identity Enable robots to have distinct personalities or characters to help users relate to them. Make sure artificial emotions do not obstruct interaction Avoid overly complex or inappropriate emotional expressions that confuse or hinder communication. References [1] J. S. Gero and U.

As stated in the paper \u0026ldquo;By prioritizing the quality and communicative properties of movement over pragmatic function or aesthetic form, we can give proper attention to the importance of movement in human communication and perception.\u0026rdquo;, before the lesson I did not know how important motion was to express emotions. During the lecture it became clear that even using a simple waterbottle and putting a piece of paper around that, already is able to show some form of emotion. Next to that I was more focussed on the actual expression of a face to express emotion and now knowing that motion is a big key factor makes it very interesting to see what you can achieve without a face or eyes. Also the lesson about using more non-antromorphic robots shows how if we do not give a robot certain human-like features the attribution of emotions is different. Since we perchieve them not as human-like and creates a cognitive dissonance however, I find it very fascinating to combine non-antromorphic robot and motion to see how well emotion can be perceived even tho they are not directly expressed. I also think that using the Wizard of Oz technique a lot of emotions or expressions can be tested which would be nice to use in our own case.\nLaban Framework \u0026amp; Alternatives The Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) framework is a structured system for understanding and describing human movement [1]. H. Knight et al. [2] used the framework to develop a set of motion features to analyze and eventually generate expressive movements in robots, mostly focussed on robot with a limited degrees of freedom. From the study it became clear that LMA principles can enhance expressiveness of robots especially in a play where non-verbal cues are used in the interaction. A. LaViers et al. also used the LMA framework to provide a non-verbal embodied vocabulary for designing robot motion that feels meaningful or intentional to humans. An important point from the study is that the LMA framework allowed the designers to create expressive movement without needing to anthropomorphize the robot.\nOne alternative to Laban is the Legibility Evaluation that is used by S. Wallkötter et al. [4], it is focussed on evaluating how understandable robot actions are and what the robot is doing and why. It is more an evalution of robots compared to Laban which is focussed on creating expressive motion.\nLaban is the main route since it can be used both to analyze human motion and generate robot motion. Every discipline is able to use this framework to create expressive motion for robots in a non-humanoid form.\nDesigning Movement to Achieve Intentionality The main part of the statement is about that a robot doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to behave like a human, it just needs to act in a way that humans can interpret as intentional. For this I would use a combination of the above mentioned approaches namely Laban and Motion Legibility to focus on creating understandable expressive motion.\nSound Design and Haptics as Means for Expression For sound design the auditory icons/earcons can be used in social robots to communicate an intention or emotion through a sound. Auditory icons are real-world sounds that have a semantic, intuitive link to the event they represent and earcons are abstract, musical or synthetic tones that follow a structured logic, like a system of beeps or motifs [5].\nFor haptics the Tactons/tactile icons framework [6] can be used in social robots to create vibration patterns or tactile cues to communicate expressions non-virtually. They are analogous to the earcons but then in the tactile domain. Touch patterns are mapped to meanings using: frequency, amplitude, duration, rhythm and location [6]. Manipulating these parameters creates different types of tactile messages.\nDesign Space of a anti-Social Robot The design space of an anti-social robot would be to create environments in which the robot behaves in a way that does not contribute to humans. It can focus on the relationship we want with robots and challenge our assumptions made about robots when for example a robot is being rude. It can show a completely different side to social interaction with a robot. Next to that it can also be helpful to create only functional robot that do not need social interaction.\nReferences [1] \u0026ldquo;Laban movement analysis,\u0026rdquo; Wikipedia, May 9, 2024.

In the picture below our division can be found.\nExisting Scenario Tools We started by making a quick overview of the tools that were in the assignment with ChatGPT to use as a starting point for choosing the scenario tools. It provided the following overview of various scenario tools with their strengths and weaknesses.\nTool Description Strengths Weaknesses Scripts Written dialogues or interactions between the user and the product Fast, intuitive, and focuses on flow Can miss spatial/contextual detail Storyboards Sequential images showing interaction moments Visual highlights emotion Time-consuming, may oversimplify Play-Acting / Role Play Acting out a scenario with/without props Embodied, real-time feedback Needs group participation, may feel awkward Stop Motion / Animation Mini-films that illustrate scenarios Engaging, repeatable, remote-friendly Requires some media skills Cards (e.g. IDEO Method Cards) Prompts or building blocks for scenario creation Quick, accessible Can feel generic without customisation Digital Tools: Storyboard That, Miro, Figma, Twine Tools for scripting, visual layout, and branching interaction Flexible, collaborative Can be overwhelming or not tailored to robot-specific needs Proposed Scenario Tool With the options in mind we soon made the decision the combine scripts and cards since they were the ones that stood out to us. After choosing these tools we searched for scientific articles about how these tools are grounded and wrote a text about this.\nFrom the research it became clear that Xu et al. [1] identified several challenges with scenario-based evaluation in the field of Human Robot Interaction (HMI). These challenges include the confidence of participants with the used media, so paper paper-based tools or digital media (videos). Another problem is the lack of interactivity, which leads to a failure to capture the dynamic relationship of human–robot interactions. Scenarios also often fail to include the dynamic real-world situations, missing details and adaptability to these situations. Scenarios might fail to represent social and emotional cues in live interactions, which are of great importance in assessing human-robot interaction.\nTo account for these limitations, the decision was made to combine scripts with a set of prompt cards. The script can be an empty template, with lines for the robot and the human the robot interacts. This allows participants to design the scenario, turn by turn, which is similar to real conversations. The prompt cards will include different personas, locations, actions and emotions. Based on these cards, the script will be written, providing a scenario that can provide various insights.\nOne of the limitations mentioned is the dynamic real-world conversations. In real life, people often wait for their turns instead of talking over each other. Robots use this turn-based logic, and using scripts as a scenario-building tool will mimic this. In scripts, clear planning of responses and events is used. Mateas and Stern [2] use scripting to manage difficult and real-time interaction between users and AI characters. This work shows how scripting can make human-computer interaction dynamic and use emotions.\nTo support this, Murray and Maher [3] explore how trajectories in interactive narratives can help structure and develop behaviour-focused human-computer systems. By leveraging these principles in Human Robot Interaction, the proposed tool encourages thinking about how interactions evolve over time, not solely as isolated events.\nDeveloping a Scenario for the Chosen Tools On the left side of the tool in yellow, there will be a pile of described input cards that can help build or prompt the script. To the right, you can see the templates for the script, which can be filled in while using the input cards. A benefit of this tool is that you can easily mimic and create real-life applications and determine what would work and what wouldn’t work. In both scenario’s the tool helped structure dynamic conversations between humans and robots, leveraging a turn-taking model. The use of prompt cards ensures variety and helps steer the conversation so that it is not a completely random script. The visual layout helped us in collaborating as a team, the collaboration helped identify gaps or unrealistic responses. This tool is specifically designed for relevant storytelling in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by offering a structured, collaborative environment to simulate and evaluate interactive scenarios between humans and robots.\nOne of the limitations of this tool is creating fully realistic emotional responses. This requires more nuanced input cards. This could be achieved by acting out the scenarios or providing this script as inspiration for something like improv theatre. The tool for now is focused on shorter narratives and quickly discovering if an application of a robot would seem logical or not. For future development, longer or evolving narratives, potentially with branching, would be needed to create more realistic stories. An addition that can be made is conflict cards, to introduce problems or tension, maybe even potential problems that can arise from interaction with the robot. This could help design scenarios that overcome these design problems. ‘Wild’ cards can also be added to involve unexpected events, to stimulate speculative thinking, and to design with the unexpected in mind.\nSession 3: Expression Paper-prop-puppeteering description and observations of simple paper-prop-puppeteering\nWe tried to express emotions using a water bottle since we felt like this object does not express emotions. We taped of any visible images/cues, to limit any influence on the emotions. Our goal was to show emotions through movements with the water bottle. We were able to create several emotions with simple movements. The emotions we used are:\nEmotion 1: Happy, water bottle turning upside down and spinning Emotion 2: Sad, waterbottle rolling on the side, slowly Emotion 3: Neutral, water bottle standing normally Emotion 4: Surprised, waterbottle goes through the air/is thrown into the air Emotion 5: Disgusted, water bottle falls on its side Emotion 6: Uninterested, turning the water bottle away Emotion 1 Emotion 2 Emotion 3 Emotion 4 Emotion 5 Emotion 6 How fast the bottle is turning, rolling, thrown into the air etc. helps express how intense the emotion is.\nWhen translating these movements the aspects that work are uninterested, neutral, happy, sad. The turning of the bottle is difficult to put into a robot like ROSE since it then needs a lot of space and is then constantly turning around.\nCombining our motion with rose shows that the different emotions can be expressed in different ways:\nNeutral can be just a standing/resting pose Uninterested can be turning the head away Sad tilting the head forward and looking to the ground Happy head held high Surprised is too difficult since you need more of a lifting emotion and that is not possible Disgusted is also difficult since letting robot collapse is not possible Expressiveness Tool The Care-Tension Cards + Improv Stage toolkit was made to help designers figure out how social robots can show their feelings and intentions in a respectful and clear way when working with older adults. It helps solve the problem of making robot behaviors that balance being independent, respecting dignity, and meeting care needs. Using realistic situations and limits, the toolkit combines role-playing with different ways robots can express themselves. This helps designers understand which robot actions are right, acceptable, and easy to understand during real care situations.\nInstructions The exercise aims to determine what expressive features the robot design would require in the broad application of elderly care. It is inspired by our scenario-building tool, but now focuses on improv theatre. It helps designers understand which and how expressive behaviour affects acceptance, clarity and comfort in elderly care scenarios. The toolkit involves improv theatre rules, props and elderly care scenario cards.\nCards in the toolkit The toolkit consists of three type of cards:\nScenario cards: \u0026ldquo;The resident refuses to eat but seems low energy. The robot needs to act.\u0026rdquo; These contain the setting and/or information for the improv theatre scene. These include real-life elderly care situations, or can be developed for specific applications. This can also be done with the scenario building tool that was developed last week. Conflict cards: Autonomy vs. safety / frustration vs. help / dignity vs. routine These cards help define the care tension in the scenario. Constraint cards: Use sound effects / No speech / limited motion The constraint cards limit the expressive modalities allowed for the robot. Multiple constrains can be used, to test out several variations of a design. Improv theatre rules The toolkit is used in rounds, each round requires at least three participants. One person plays the elder/user, one person the robot, and the last person is the observer.\nIt is allowed to include props, these can include the following:\nSmall speaker to initiate sound effects Different textiles: plush, or harder metal materials Phone / tablets to help act out certain scenarios General home objects, depending on the setting of the scenarios With these props and additional tools, the facilitator and actors need to keep in mind the limitations of the limitation card. A scene should not last too long, but it is up to the facilitator to end a scene.\nSession 4: Embodiment Usage of Pepper and Nao Yes, a majority of social robotics research still uses Pepper and NAO. These robots are widely available, easy to program, and supported by a strong developer community. While newer robots like Furhat, QTrobot, and ARI are emerging, we believe after looking at some projects that Pepper and NAO remain the majority in many studies, not because they\u0026rsquo;re ideal for every task, but simply because they\u0026rsquo;re accessible and versatile. Despite Pepper\u0026rsquo;s limited commercial success, it’s still heavily used in labs and experiments.\nTotal Freedom over the Embodiment and Suitability and Matrix If we were to have total freedom over the embodiment, the robots would be better adapted to the context in which they operate. If it better fits the needs and requirements of the context/environment, it can lead to richer interactions with the robot. The form of the robot seems to define the function in social robotics. The problem with Pepper/Nao is that it is a generalised robot that can function in various environments, without necessarily adapting its embodiment. This can lead to a mismatch in size with the user group, either too small or too big. Pepper \u0026amp; Nao also have limited mobility, limited facial expression, and the humanoid look is leaning towards the uncanny valley for some users. If possibilities were endless, embodiments should include more non-humanoid shapes. In addition, the size should match the environment in which they are used. So, use smaller robots for things like tabletop learning, and bigger robots for transportational functionalities.\nWith all these things in mind we created a matrix for all the robots that were seen during the lecture:\nFeature/Robot Clicbot DJI Robomaster S1 Miko 2 Robot Robot Cat (VibraPurr) mTiny Robot Winky Robot Anki Vector Roybi Robot EMO Picture Size Small Small battlebot-like Small Small Small Small and round Small Small Small Shape Toy-like, modular Toy-like, tank-like Toy-like, rounded Animal, cat-like Toy-like, cube Toy-like, circular head Compact, cube-shaped Toy-like, rounded Toy-like, humanoid-like Colour White and grey Black and grey Blue and white White, grey, beige White with accents Blue, red, white Black with screen face White and pink Black with LED face Face One-eyed face screen No face Screen with two eyes \u0026ldquo;Miauw\u0026rdquo; face Two panda eyes, drawn mouth Screen with two eyes Screen with two eyes Round screen Screen with color-changing eyes Mobility Wheels, can move like a worm Moves with wheels Small wheels Moves paws, rotates body Small wheels Wheels, moves head and ears Moves with wheels, interacts Static Walks and dances on two legs Emotion Expression Voice, screen, movement Not really, but can shoot Expresses emotions (various) Moves, purrs, \u0026ldquo;miauws\u0026rdquo; Facial expressions, movement Eyes, sound, movement Eyes, sound, movement Voice and eye expressions Dances, eyes, sound effects Context STEM education, coding Competitive robotics Child learning \u0026amp; fun Elder companionship Preschool coding Child entertainment Home assistant Language learning Home companion Expectation Match High (creativity, coding) High (remote-controlled action) Moderate to high (kids) High (pet replacement) High (early education) Moderate (fun-focused) Moderate Moderate (education focus) Moderate (novelty, companion) Developing an Embodiment Design Tool As idea we came up with a card game in which players use cards that represent real robot features. The features that are represented are appearance, capabilities, personality traits and contexts. The card game aims to build a robot that best fits the challenge.\nThe card types used are:\nCard Type Description Examples Form Cards (blue) Physical traits: size, shape, material, color Small \u0026amp; Round, Soft Animal, Transparent Casing Function Cards (green) Capabilities: movement, sensors, expressions Wheels + Head Rotation, Facial Recognition, LED Eye Display Emotion Cards (red) Emotional expressions, personality traits Playful Voice, Shy Posture, Purring Sound Context Cards (yellow) Usage scenarios Hospital Room, Preschool Class, Home Office Challenge Cards (black) Design briefs that drive gameplay A robot to help anxious children, A guide in a noisy museum How to Play\nStep 1: Draw a Challenge Card\nExample: “Design a robot for calming patients in a waiting room.” Step 2: Each player builds a robot\nChoose 1 Form, 2 Function, 1 Emotion, and 1 Context card. Players can use real robot examples (Clicbot, Pepper, Vector, etc.) for inspiration printed on each card (or drawn randomly). Step 3: Describe and pitch your robot\nGive your robot a name, describe how it looks, acts, and why it fits the challenge. Use storytelling or a sketch to present. Step 4: Vote or Judge\nPlayers vote on the most creative, functional, or emotionally appropriate robot design. Sources [1] Q. Xu, J. Ng, O. Tan, Z. Huang, B. Tay, and T.

Using a multidisciplinary approach and gathering projects from different fields to make social robots Assessing humanoid factors through: discussing the level of intuitiveness of an artifact; describing the interaction channels of the artifact from the viewpoint of the pragmatic of human communication; measuring the face-ism index of the artifact; defining the position of the artifact in the uncanny valley diagram Designing a robotic interface is complex due to lack of standards and it being in development stages in which it is difficult to combine all the different tech parts Importance of having a face as interface that is intuitive and familiar for people to have an interaction Engaging users in design leads to more relevant and accepted social robot designs in the case of InMoov, iCub and Ono. Chapter 9 Embodiment vs Digital Content The general statements that can be made regarding embodiment vs ditigal content are:\nA mobile phone can be seen as a social robot since they provoke strong emotional responses and create bonds with people even though they do not have a very much physical embodiment of a social robot since they only consist out of a screen and haptic feedback Creating an emotional connection with people is done through personalized content and not through physical interaction Currently a lot of people are already addicted to their screen which means that they adapted to screens and do not always need a human face to interact with something. We do not always need actuators because people are able to attribute personality and emotion to for example a phone in which only digital interaction is used\nThe parts of embodiment that turn a smartphone into a social robot are:\nA personality that stays the same Changing behavior Giving feedback Timing when to say what Able to understand context My perspective after watching \u0026lsquo;Her\u0026rsquo; In the movie \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; the embodiment is not really present since Samantha does not have a body however still the relationship can be felt through the connection she creates. This is done through having certain rituals, being responsive, having a memory and also having a voice. This gives Samantha a character which can be seen by a human and changes the look for me from an actual robot that is social to creating an interaction which has certain features from which a human can sense trust and familiarity.\nVincent vs Bar-Cohen When comparing the focus of Vincent with Bar-Cohen it becomes clear that Vincent focuses on the cultural, ethical and psychological dimensions of human-robot interaction while Bar-Cohen is more optimistic and looks at the use of technology to make humanoids acceptable in different types of fields such as the healthcare and a household.\nThe real-world deviated from the predicted revolution since humanoid robots are still not very acceptable since they are too complex and expensive but also unnecessary for many tasks. People are very much focussed on their privacy and stand up against the ethical challenges that arise with social robots. The social acceptance is still low and slowed down the integration of robots in everyday life. However another type of robot became popular which are the smart assistants such as Alexa and Siri.\nRobot Hotel The robot hotel was a hotel which promised automation through using humanoid robots when comparing the robot hotel with the CitizenM hotel which uses automation it becomes clear that the focus of the robot hotel was wrong. They failed since their UX was not strong enough to keep guests away from usability issues and frustration. The humanoid robots were too annoying and often broke down which was not worth the trouble. They tried making different robots for a lot of different features which could easily be handled by people themselves. The robot should add functional or emotional value and that was not the case it only created trouble.\nNabaztag Rabbit Nabaztag is a communicating object in the shape of a rabit, it had a sort of personality which had ears, lights and speech. It fits the definition of a social robot since it tries to have a personality with emotional responses and a physical interface. It was not successfull due to the use of the robot being very unclear, responsiveness was not that great and it depended on the network which did not work great and was technically fragile in general. The design was ahead of its time but the emotional connection was not there enough and prove unsuccessful.\nCuddlebits Paper The key insights in the role and application of design research in the Cuddlebits projects are:\nMinimal robots which can show different emotions Building emotions from rhythm, haptics and expectations Helps make clear the feelings people had about about the robot and the trustworthiness Focussing on legibility of emotions through subtle movements and engaging users through adapting to robots behavior ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/socialrobotdesign/reflectionweek1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"pointers-from-social-robots-from-a-human-perspective-chapter-8\"\u003ePointers from Social Robots from a Human Perspective Chapter 8\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pointers from chapter 8 include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSharing robot projects open-source encourages people to make their own social robot and broaden the field of social robotics but also make robots more accessible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing a multidisciplinary approach and gathering projects from different fields to make social robots\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssessing humanoid factors through: discussing the level of intuitiveness of an artifact; describing the interaction channels of the artifact from the viewpoint of the\npragmatic of human communication; measuring the face-ism index of the artifact; defining the position of the artifact in the uncanny valley diagram\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDesigning a robotic interface is complex due to lack of standards and it being in development stages in which it is difficult to combine all the different tech parts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImportance of having a face as interface that is intuitive and familiar for people to have an interaction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEngaging users in design leads to more relevant and accepted social robot designs in the case of InMoov, iCub and Ono.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"chapter-9-embodiment-vs-digital-content\"\u003eChapter 9 Embodiment vs Digital Content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general statements that can be made regarding embodiment vs ditigal content are:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Reflective Questions Session 1: Design Tools"},{"content":"Categorisation for Robot/AI stories The categorisation I can come up with for Robot/AI stories is that you can divide them into three main categories namely themes, purposes and emotional response. With the three categories more subcategories can be made in which the main ones are combined.\nMoral dilemmas in which real-world problems are challenged by robots/AI Reshaping humans and society through telling stories about changing human identity or society in general with robots/AI Emotional support in which robots/AI have roles in which they are like a friend or companion to a human Dystopian stories in which fears that currently exist about robots/AI are blown up and become true such as taking over the world Utopian stories in which the world can be saved by robots/AI and they are praised contradicting the dystopian stories Johnson B.D. Approach and Differences Johnson introduced Science Fiction Prototyping as a method to imagine and explore future technologies through storytelling. Johnson advocates the following five step process for writing Science Fiction Prototypes:\nPick Your Science and Build Your World Identify the Scientific Inflection Point Consider ramifications of the Science on People Identify the Human Inflection Point Reflect on what Did We Learn? The difference between Science Fiction Prototyping (SFP) and Generic Scenario-Based Design (SBD) is that SFP uses storytelling to understand and change the human experience with future technologies while SBD develops specific use cases to inform design decisions and usability. Next to that they are also different in outcome since SBD tries to improve the functionality or user experience of a product and SFP on the other hand is more about opening up a discussion and reflecting on implications that future technologies might have. SFP is more broad and about what the future can bring while SBD is specific and practical.\n21st Century Robot Project and NOA-like Personality The 21st Century Robot project aimed to create a customizable, open-source robot platform. The robot became NAO-like since the robot had predictable behavior since all the tasks and interactions were scripted. Next to that the robot had a friendly appearance which made it look very approachable and non-threatening. Choosing different storytelling or design approaches could have led to a robot which was not looking friendly and no full control of the interaction but could be more dynamic.\nStorytelling in Consumer Robotics Consumer robots are often marketed as friendly, being a companion and being intelligent. These stories can differ from reality since robots often lack real intelligence, autonomy and emotions. But also often do not have all the features that are being told about since they are technically unachievable. The stories often disappoint users and are misleading.\nStorytelling Considerations in SRD The storytelling aspects which you should consider when designing social robots are:\nBackstories: A background story for a robot can help create relatability and connection. Personality: Creating a robot that has well-defined and consistent personality features helps users to predict the behavior of the robot Roles: Stating which purpose and capabilities the robot has makes sure that users expectations align with the robot functionalities. The uncanny valley is where entities that closely resemble humans but are not quite lifelike, elicit discomfort. This can be linked to the story since a difference in appearance and behavior of the robot can create a dissonance for users which can cause discomfort for users.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/socialrobotdesign/reflectionweek2/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"categorisation-for-robotai-stories\"\u003eCategorisation for Robot/AI stories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe categorisation I can come up with for Robot/AI stories is that you can divide them into three main categories namely themes, purposes and emotional response.

From our first selection of problems, we picked the unintuitiveness of cars; how hard it is to know what is wrong with one without training and/or extensive documentation / help. Rationale; tinkering mindset to make something technically difficult accessible.\nDuring the brainstorm we made some sketches on a whiteboard The two ideas that came from the brainstorm were:\nEducation kit for cars Many people, especially children, grow up without a basic understanding of how car engines work, making regular car maintenance and unexpected roadside issues difficult to handle. The solution: A kit that you can give to children (or adults) that gives them an intuition for the parts present in a car. VR kit A VR kit that shows people what they can find under the hood of a car. Pitches We pitched these two ideas and received feedback about the feasibility of the ideas. The mindset and type of idea was really fitting for a tinkering session. However, since making these ideas would mean that we would go big which would be difficult to make in real-life. We got a tip to look more into the Invento kits since it would be building materials that have the same scale as our ideas. We could use this as part of our scaffolding materials which would be given out during our tinkering session. Next to that we received the feedback that our workshop was too little open-ended and would turn more into a teaching session instead of a tinkering one.\nAfter the pitches we increased our tinkerability through refining our scope to the concept of energy transformation specifically a combustion engine which translates pressure into movement. We wanted to let kids explore the concept of pressure and to turn it into motion and/or direction. The general goal was to let people explore mechanical mechanisms. One the ideas was to give two (or more) translating motors and some other materials to people for a workshop. The goal is to turn the translating movement into a rotating movement and do something cool with it (among the materials will be wheels, propellers and other cool rotating stuff).\nOur main technical hurdle in this phase was the difficulty of creating an actually working piston + crankshaft system. Our building block would be this component, and through a life-size scale this building block would have an inviting affordance, allowing participants to transform muscle force to pressure to movement. A wide range of other components would be supplied so that participants could then use this movement to create whatever they deemed cool.\nSketches of translating wind into motion We used this idea and pitched it again, after reflecting we realised that, though the idea was nice. The building blocks we had thought up would be very hard to realise within the scope of this course. So we made another switch, this time not necessarily for tinkerability\u0026rsquo;s sake, but so that the concept would become something we could realise. We kept the theme of energy transfer but made it more feasible by switching from pistons to sails. We chose this idea since most of our group members have experience with windsurfing and know how the wind is transformed into movement. Next to that most of have handy materials laying around or access to surfing materials so ideas could easily be realised. In addition, this idea requires less precision in the materials used, pistons need to be airtight for example. This meant that prototyping was more forgiving and easy to make different models. A downside to this idea is that the workshop is difficult to do without the wind and thus very reliant on the wind conditions.\nSession Design Work After thinking out the idea we tried making a division between pre-designed parts and what to leave to be tinkered with. the first idea was to make a pre-made sail which we give to the people as building block. They were able to make their own surfboard or boat or skateboard on which the sail can be attached. This again meant that the workshop was not really open-ended that is why we changed to a different building block. We tried making it open-ended through letting people build their own sail and surfboard/skateboard in the workshop. People are able to create many different sail types and boards which can be used to translate wind into motion. People can choose between making something that can be used on land and in water. People should be able to do whatever they want to do with the materials we provide to harness the wind. However we do want to provide some building blocks which make it easier to build a sail.\nThese building blocks make sure users can quickly and easily carry out their ideas in a physical way. The blocks take care of that the sail cloth can be easily attached to a mast, a mast can be easily mounted to their board and that a sail frame can be made. We thus need to design connectors for attaching rods/masts to each other and the structure and a way to easily attach sail cloth to those rods\nPrototyping We started designing and making preliminary design for the three building blocks. As first step we chose a PVC pipe from designlab which we were going to be using for the rods. We chose fo PVC pipes since they are easy to use and cheap. We tried making the sail cloth connector and rod connector with a 3d printer since our first idea was to make it with TPU which can be done on a 3D printer. Next to that protoyping with a 3d printer is accessible and cheap especially since a group member has a 3d printer.\nThere are three different types of building blocks with each different iteration cycles.\nSail cloth connector Is used to connect the sail cloth to the rods The sail cloth that we used are old surfing kites which were broken and were otherwise thrown in the bin. We used them since they are lightweight, reasonably sturdy and accessible to us. To connect the cloth to the rods we had multiple iterations. In version 1 we used old rubber bicycle handlebars, we cut them open and fitted them around the rod to which the sail was connected. Since it is made out of rubber it was very grippy on the sail. It worked okay ish but since the rubber was flexible the connector came of way too easily when pressure was used. In version 2 we used a corrugation tube which makes it a bit too unflexible to easily clip on but makes for a more snug fit. The material of the tubes hard/smooth so there was not enough grip, that is when we decided to make our own sail cloth connector with a 3d printer.\nSail cloth clip versions After printing and changing dimensions ten times we got a clip that was snapping onto the pipe and not coming of too easily. Next to the sailclip we tried making a clip that could be tie down with a rope.\nSail cloth clip 3d printed Rod connector Is used to connect different rods together to create a frame Rod connector sketches The first idea was to make the rod connectors flexible so they could be easily bended and make the frame of the sail. After sketching out some ideas we tried modelling and 3d printing them to see if they would work. The clips on the left have a rope which make sure you can tie down the rod so they will not go off easily. However when modelling the sketch we came to the conclusion that when you connect the rods in the connectors they would be aligned horizontally, this does not help making a shape for a sail. The rods needs to be connected in different angles and lining up horizontally to create a shape. To connect the rods in the most simple way in an angle we made the second sketch in a model. Since the dimensions of the rod were known it was easy to create and 3d print this shape. It worked nicely but the downside to this model is that the angle is not able to rotate and the connector needs to be slided onto the frame. This creates restrictions in easily creating different shapes. After that we tried 3d printing with TPU but this could not be done with the 3d printed available to one of the group members. We still wanted to create a connector that had different angles.\nRod connector models That is why we tried to use a model closely related to the sail cloth clip. This model has some requirements namely to change the angle and connecting the rods in any place. After sketching, an idea came up and this idea was 3d printed. The idea was to make two differnt parts which had magnets attached. One part is a bigger version of the sail clip and the other is a block which can be changed to a block that has different angels. This makes it easy to connect them in different angels and change things up when needed. When testing the prototype it became clear that when force was applied the magnets would not be strong enough to keep the two parts together and thus create a frame for the sail. In the next steps we only used the rigid 90 degree angle connector.\nRod connector improved model During the testing of our workshop and gathering material we cam across multiple difficulties. One of the difficulties was that when searching for more rods it became clear that we had chosen a PVC pipe which was not a standard dimension. After going to a lot of different stores we chose a standard dimension and added foam around it so the clips that were made were still able to fit around the pipe tightly. This made the pipes less rigid, but we were able to use the same clips without needing to print new ones. Also an advantage was that now the dimensions were not that strict so we were able to use all of the prototypes of the clips and did not needed to print more.\nRod problems Baseplate Is used to connect the mast with the board For the baseplate multiple sketches and a model were made. However, when getting the rods it became clear that the baseplate was not needed anymore. The existing windsurfing baseplates were able to fit perfectly into the rods and it thus became redundant. To connect the rods with the baseplate more sturdy we added holes to the pipes so they can be attached to mast feet with a piece of rope. We made sketches for creating different baseplates to connect to different boards but during the testing we used a mountainboard board which has a baseplate and we did not worked this out further.\nNext to the prototypes we made cards which we can show to people to give them idea about what type of sail to build. Pictures of these cards can be found on the poster.\nFor the testing we brought a lot of old kites, scissors, knives and ropes so people were able to make their own sail. We tested with group member who did not have knowledge about sail and she was able to build her own sail according to the idea she had. It worked out nicely and made more sails during the demo day. Below an overview of the sail that were made can be found.\nShowing the sails! As an overview of the project the poster can be found below.

You are constantly focussing on how things fit together and can be changed. It also has big impact on being scared to try stuff out, you are constantly doing things and mostly exploring with your hands which removes this anxiety.\nTinkering with digital and electronic media Tinkering with digital and electronic media adds some form of interaction since often sensors or microcontrollers are used which are able to provide some form of feedback. It also combines the physical world with the computing world to create something. Coding is also open-ended however there are some rules or syntax which must be used in order to get it working.\nReproducibility in tinkering Reproducing something is often done through using documentation, this is something which can be made but is often about the result. While in tinkering the process is often way more important. You are more focussed on exploring than making something reproducible. When you are tinkering often you end up changing a lot of things around the way and just trying stuff out. When a result of that is documented it does not teach the same lessons. Tinkering is more about adapting as you go than about making something reproducible.\nIterative prototyping and tinkering cycles Tinkering is often open-ended where as prototyping is mostly done with a specific goal in mind. Prototypes are often tested and improved to get the best version. In tinkering the process is the most important and the ability to explore different things. I do think however that it is not black and white and that tinkering and prototyping are often overlapping.\nCo-design as tinkering session I think a co-design session can be described as a tinkering session when it has certain features. Most importantly the co-design session must be hands-on, open-ended and exploratory to fit the tinkering principle. Next to that the support/facilitator in a co-design session must be focussed on helping people sharing, trying and also failing.\nInfluence of materials in a co-design session I think the results can be influenced since there are many types of materials which result in different outcomes. For exmaple using cardboard encourages people to take risks and be really hands-on. If the material provided is less valuable there will be different outcomes compared to using an Arduino kit. The materials can influence the outcomes but do not always control the outcomes since people use them and do the things they want. This can not be predicted up front by choosing a certain type of material. I think the influencing the outcome with the type of materials is nice since people can be pushed into a certain direction to create certain outcomes. Next to that it is also not very nice since you want to give people the ability to choose the direction they want to go in.\nTinkering in research through design I think tinkering in research through design can fill in the design part since it shows people many different options through creating designs. Not only differnt options but also why they do or do not work and how people can interact with them. It helps to solve problems in a hands-on way.\nUntinkerable design questions I think there are quite some design questions in which tinkering it not really possible. These situations do not have an open end or use strict rules and regulations also high fidelity with a lot of details is diffucult to achieve with tinkering. I think in these areas it can provide new creative options which are often overlooked but these options sometimes mean that they are unachievable in real life. Next to that questions that use many different materials are also not really feasbile since you are unable to explore them all. Tinkering often gives many ideas and insight but does not give a perfect end-result that solves all.\nBalancing real-world with the fruitful mindset of tinkering I think a good combination for this would be to have a sweet spot between exploring and asking yourself questions about the real-world. For exmaple when an idea takes shape to step back put on your critical glasses and ask yourself questions such as What am i learning? What problem does this idea solve? Can this be used in the real world? After answering these questions you can decide to further explore certain ideas or comments to dive deeper.\nCritical impact of tinkering exercises A positive critical impact my tinkering exercise could have is that I am able to create and come up with many new ideas while improving my problem-solving skills and working hands-on which can be useful in other parts of my life.\nA negative impact can be that ideas might still be vague and not only answer top-level questions without deep diving into the real problems and how to solve them. Next to that the lack of direction can also contribute to this since you are also staying more on the surface.\nEnvironmental impact of a session I think that using reusable and recyclable materials can be necessary to keep down the amount of stuff and ecological footprint a session uses. Another thing can be to disassemble the materials and use them again. I think it is also important to show the people that this aspect is often overlooked and is important to think about and reflect on during and after such a session. A session should be tailored to let people fully explore but it is not always only fun and for this people need to take responsibility about they used.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/assignments/05-design-work-critical-making/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-5-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 5 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"knowledge-resulting-from-tinkering\"\u003eKnowledge resulting from tinkering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge resulting from tinkering in my experience is mostly problem solving skills and creativity.

I chose a metaphor about a maze since a maze can only be navigated with concepts that appear in coding. The maze is turned into a game which is played on a magnetic board from Ikea and for the set up I now used a field that is 150 x 250 mm. Since the magnetic board is bigger (400 x 600 mm) than the current playing field the maze set up can be changed to bigger and smaller fields. On this board 3D printed barriers can be put to create a maze setup. A start and end point should be determined and a character is put at the start. To navigate the character cards are available, on these cards specific movements can be found. These cards resemble different programming concepts. The player can make their own character with Lego or 3d print a figure they like.\nPlaying field part 1 Playing field part 2 Cards The player gets a lot of different cards which can be used during the game. The cards can be found below with an explanation of the used programming concepts.\nExplanation of the cards and programming concepts used Appearance of the cards General Loop If-else Function Examples using cards Below are the cards when used during the game.\nExample solving maze Loop If-else Function Tinkering process Of course I did not end up at the end product without a tinkering process. I first started coming up with ideas that I could use and that were the calendar and maze. I have a 3d printer which I wanted to use since tinkering is an on going process and I could easily tweak settings and models and also direclty see the results and process. For both of them I worked them out in more detail to see what needs to be made. The calendar was a really fun idea but for the magnets I could not come up with an idea to get them 3d printed well enough to be able to read them. That is why I chose the maze and starting by making two different types of block to see which dimensions whould fit the game best. These dimensions were 20x20mm and 25x25mm. In the pictures a side to side comparison can be found.\nCalendar idea Maze idea Block versions I chose for the bigger block since it made building a maze simple enough and the blocks were big enough that a character would fit next to them. After looking into the dimensions I looked into the options to use magnets in the blocks. In my building block I used magnets on every side of the block which in this case is not necessary since the block do not have to connect with each other, only the board. That is why I chose to put one magnets on the bottom of the block. Since I changed some parts of my 3d printer I needed to change the dimensions of the hole for the magnet to fit. After the magnets were able to fit in the block I started looking into the setup of the maze, how big the playing field should be. For this I tried to sketch it which can be seen in the pictures below. I used this sketch as layout for the maze but the layout can be changed to whatever setup the player likes. To make the field changeable I looked into how it would be the easiest to make changing borders. Since the blocks are squares they take quite long to pring and you need a lot of them to be able to make the border of the game. That is why I changed the border to rectangular blocks which have two magnets on both sides.\nThe playing field is 150 x 250 mm and each block is 25 x 25 mm, I chose to make all the borders 125 mm since the field needs an entrance and exit on the sides which means that the vertical side needs to be 150 mm - 25 mm = 125 mm. The horizontal side is 250 mm and the border block is 125 x 10 mm which means that for the horizontal side the block should be 250 + 2*10 = 270 mm. To see if the same rectangular block can be used I divided 270 / 2 = 135 mm. Since the lengts of the vertical and horizontal blocks do not differ that much I used the same length of 125 mm for both sides. This leaves the corners not completely blocked but makes it easier to change the field and removew the need for many different pieces.\nMaze idea sketches Maze playing field sketch Playing field setup sketch After making all the sketches I started printing the block and modelling the rectangular block. The printer had a lot of printing time and some difficulties with settings and normal Ender 3d printer problems. I tweaked some settings and changed the infill to 10% since the blocks do not have to be strong. Some prints had trouble with being the correct hole size for the magnet so I adjusted the holes with a screwdriver which worked fine and then the magnets fit tightly.\nBlock model Rectangular block model After everything was printed I set up the maze I sketched and tried to solve the maze with the cards. These are the pictures that can be seen at the cards examples. The final version of the maze is the picture at the top of this page and I really enjoyed making it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/individual-assignments/programming-paradigm/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"scaffolding-exercise---hack-the-maze\"\u003eScaffolding Exercise - Hack the Maze\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the scaffolding exercise I looked at multiple metaphors for coding.

Children are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO. Adults might need more encouragement to start, be creative and keep going assuring them that they can not do something wrong. Adults have not played in a long time so some start up time should also be kept in mind.\nRelevant Concepts Hands-on: using your hands to express your thoughts Metaphors: expressing ideas with metaphors that can be found in the LEGO Sharing \u0026amp; Safety: making sure people speak up and listen to what others say in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Teaching: Papert \u0026amp; Montessori From the Invent to Learn book chapter 5 multiple key principles by Papert and Montessori can be identified.\nThe Key Principles of Papert Constructionism: Learning happens when people are actively making something they care about. Learning through tinkering: Using a hands-on, trial-and-error approach to learning. Children should experiment, build, and refine their ideas through iterative design cycles Powerful ideas and microworlds: Learning should be about powerful ideas, concept that have lasting significance and can be applied in multiple contexts. While using microworlds, self-contained digital environments where learners could experiment with complex concepts in a simplified setting Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls: design learning environments that have a Low floor: easy to get started High ceiling: allowing for deep and complex explorations Wide walls: encouraging creativity Personal curricula: Education should be based on self-directed exploration, teachers encourage tinkering and learning together The role of computers: Using computers to extend cognitive abilities The Key Principles of Montessori Hands-on learning: Learning through direct, physical interaction with materials Prepared environment: Design classrooms to promote independent learning, every material has specific purpose Intrinsic motivation and self directed learning: Children learn best when they follow their own curiosity, use materials that are self-correcting so children discover their mistakes on their own. Freedom within limits: Children should have the freedom to choose their activities but within a carefully structured environment Mixed-age classrooms and peer learning Observation and adaption: Teachers act as guides, they step back and let children explore while intervening only when necessary Overlap Between Papert and Montessori Papert and Montessori both emphazise on active and hands-on learning and giving the children the space to decide what they want to learn. They encourage children to learn through doing and experimenting while keeping the level of instruction at the minimum. Children are encouraged to make mistakes and follor their own paths.\nDifference Between Papert and Montessori Paper and Montessori also have differences in their approach with the most prominent one being the use of technology. Papert uses computers as learning devices while Montessori prefers physical and meaningfull materials. They also differ in their way of structuring the environment around the children, Papert uses an open-ended and more explorative environment while Montessori uses a prepared environment in which children can do things within the boundaries of the environment. Lastly, Papert and Montessori also differ in their view of the role of a teacher. Papert mostly lets the teachers encourage the children to learn together and tinker while Montessori put the role as a teacher more as a guide which only intervene when necessary.\nTinkering for Children of Different Ages For young children aged 3 to 6 both of the mantra are valuable since they encourage children to explore through a hands-on approach using different materials. When a child gets older (6-12 years) Papert introduces the use of computers which opens up a whole new world of problems to solve. While Montessori still uses the same materials but with more difficult problems. Teenagers in the Papert approach use even more programming while Montessori mostly focusses on for example applications of math. Montessori has great principles which work well for young children while Papert using the computers has more relevant principles for children growing up, especially in a world where digital tools are becoming more and more important. Combining hands-on learning with physical materials with digital problem solving sounds like a future proof approach to education.\nShaping the Learning Environment Useful Pointers Space and Setting for Tinkering From the Invent to Learn book chapter 9 multiple pointers are named, these useful pointers include:\nFlexible \u0026amp; Adaptable Documentation Accessible Tools \u0026amp; Materials Culture of Experimentation The message given is that learning spaces should intentionally be designed to foster creativity, agency and self-directed exploration. Makerspaces are not just about a place to use tools and materials but are about setting a mindset where poeple see themselves as inventors and problem-solvers.\nNecessity of a Designlab/Fablab A designlab/fablab is not needed since the mindset about making and being an inventor can be used everywhere. The most important things are that the environment supports creativity and exploration.\nPractice as a Designer/Engineer Using Tinkering I use Tinkering in the ideation and prototyping phase of a project. In the ideation phase I use it to generate multiple ideas. In the prototyping phase I mostly use it to explore different features and test the prototypes.\nTranslating Design and Research Problems into a Tinkering Playground A design or research problem can be translated into a tinkering playground through breaking it into smaller parts which can be solved by using open-ended materials. After solving the smaller parts it can be combined to solve the bigger problem.\nGetting Unstuck Things to use when you get stuck are to use different materials then the ones currently used and also looking in the world around you to see how the problem can be seen in other ways so looking for an analogous solution. It can also be useful to involve others in your tinkering process to get different perspectives and solutions and work around the part were you are stuck at. Another option is to stop and go for a walk to give your brain some rest and focus on other things.\nGetting in the Flow To get in the flow I make sure that people are not able to distract me and that there are a lot of different materials present. I feel like just starting and doing random stuff also helps to start the ideas. I mostly start sketching or making stuff with 3d modelling or LEGO blocks to see which options can be found. After the first options are there you can explore one of the options or generate more options. I can completely lose myself once I start seeing multiple options and want to explore them all.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/assignments/03-facilitation2/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-3-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 3 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lego-serious-play\"\u003eLEGO Serious Play\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"role-of-adults-in-facilitation\"\u003eRole of Adults in Facilitation?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChildren are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO.

I chose these criteria since I felt like they support creativity, exploration and learning by doing. The criteria appeared in the \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; chapter and in affordances by Norman. My definitions of the criteria are:\nSelf guiding: Does it guide you into how to use it? Preciousness: Is what you make and the material valuable? Skills needed: Can you use it without needing to develop a skill? Interoperability: Does it work with other materials? Seeing the process: Do you see what is happening during the process? Seeing the results: Do you see the results when you are done? I used a ranking system consisting of plusses and minusses.

the material table I chose the criteria of self guiding, preciousness, skills needs, interoperability, seeing the process and seeing the results.

My definitions of the criteria are:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Material Table"},{"content":"Week 2 Reflective Questions I was not physically present during session two and received some information from peers but that was not very useful. I looked into the concept of Affordance and searched for all the different materials online to make the material table. The table can be found on the material table tab.\nThe concept of affordance is used to give a better understanding about what makes materials good for tinkering. The concept of affordance can be viewed from two perspectives, namely Gibson and Norman. Gibson is focussed on the ecological psychology [1] and Norman used the human-computer interaction (HCI) framework [2].\nGibson in 1977 defined affordance as \u0026ldquo;offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill\u0026rdquo; [3] So in other words it refers to all action possibilities with an object based on user\u0026rsquo;s physical capabilities [4].\nIn 1988 Norman introduces the concept of affordance to the design community and changed the definition a bit so it could be easier used for designers [4]. He defined it as \u0026ldquo;perceivable action possibilities\u0026rdquo; in other words only actions which users consider possible. Designer must keep affordances in mind when designing product or services since elements of their design suggest how user can use their product or services.\nConnecting the concept of affordance to tinkering materials shows us that the materials that have clear affordances help people tinker. They invite people to start exploring and use the materials in different ways. Materials that suggest that they can be used in multiple ways encourage creativity, learning and experimentation.\nFrom the chapter \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; it also becomes clear that they emphaze to create an environment and tools that support open-ended exploration and invention. Their view on making designs that are intuitive and invite interaction closely relate to Norman and his view on the perceived affordances. Through the use of materials and tools that suggest their functionalities, a tinkering mindset is encouraged.\nCombining all of the frameworks and opinions this means that in tinkering, materials that have multiple functionalities and that suggest their possibilities need to be designed or used to encourage exploration. This helps people to know what we can do with things just by looking or touching them [4].\nReferences\nWikipedia contributors. (n.d.). James Jerome Gibson. Wikipedia.

For my building block I first started making a lot of different sketches which can be seen below. I started with thinking about a lot of different shapes and existing building blocks. After that I tried to combine parts to get a new building block.\nSketches of building block shapes With the block itself more clear I started thinking about different ways to connect the blocks. After I made all the sketches I looked back and looked at what would be feasible to make. I chose the square form since it can be easily modelled and I chose to connect the block with magnets since they are versitile to use and connect blocks in different places. Magnets are also a part which does not break easily compared to a 3d printed interlocking system.\nSketches of connecting blocks Building Block Progress Week 2 I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems were not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. I also tried printing other models but the problems remained. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don\u0026rsquo;t they get on your nerves! The problem was not solveable within this week so I went to Designlab to get it printed. Below you can see the results!\nEnd result One block Stack of blocks Print failures Failures More failures Models Test model Block model Alternative model I tried making the alternative model but came to the conclusion that it is difficult to connect the square with a pentagon. So I let that one be an idea that was not executed.

In my workspace I have a lot of different materials and tools which I am able to use, these are:\n3D printer Wood tools Sander Hammer Screwdrivers Pliers Lego Sewing kit Arduino kit Electronic parts Laptop Sketchbooks Pencils Markers Paint Brushes I tinker the most in the Design domain more specific in the electronics and 3D printing domains. In these domains the tinkering helps to create prototypes and also iterate these prototypes to see in what ways a prototype can be made and what can be changed. After that the tinkering helps to combine all of these prototypes into one main idea.\nTo get away from my screen I like to take pictures and make drawings.\nI have a lot of item on my wishlist but the main ones are to have a 3D printer that is able to print TPU and a soldering station.\nReflective Questions Question 1 Definitions according to the Cambridge Dictionary [1]\nTinkering: to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it Trial-and-error: a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make Brainstorming: an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development All three have to do with improving or solving a problem Improving an existing product or coming up with a new product Ways of creating new ideas and products\nThe definition of tinkering from the dictionary has more to do with making changes to something that exists while the definition in the course is more about using materials to epxlore options. To explore options also small changes can be made. The dictionary definition is directed at a goal to repair or improve something but the course definition does not start with a goal. Exploring options is most often also done in small steps so in that way they match.\nAI tool [2] Definition\nTinkering: This is an open-ended, hands-on approach to learning and problem-solving. It involves experimenting with materials and ideas through playful exploration, allowing for creativity and personal expression. Tinkering encourages individuals to identify problems and work on solving them in creative ways, often without a predetermined outcome. Trial-and-Error: This method involves attempting various solutions to a problem until finding one that works. It\u0026rsquo;s a process of making repeated, varied attempts, learning from mistakes, and gradually approaching a desired result. This approach is fundamental in learning and problem-solving, emphasizing persistence and adaptation. Brainstorming: A creative technique where individuals or groups generate a multitude of ideas to address a specific issue or challenge. This method encourages open thinking and the free flow of ideas, promoting innovative solutions and collaboration. Comparison:\nApproach:\nTinkering: Hands-on, experimental, and iterative, focusing on exploration and making. Trial-and-Error: Systematic testing of various solutions until success is achieved. Brainstorming: Idea generation through discussion, without immediate evaluation. Outcome:\nTinkering: May lead to unexpected discoveries or innovations. Trial-and-Error: Aims to find a working solution through elimination. Brainstorming: Produces a broad range of ideas for potential solutions. Process:\nTinkering: Involves playful interaction with materials and concepts. Trial-and-Error: Involves testing and learning from failures. Brainstorming: Involves collaborative ideation Does the Course Definition Match the Dictionary Definition? Yes, but with more depth! The course definition aligns with the dictionary definition of tinkering in that both emphasize hands-on, exploratory, and iterative approaches.\nKey Difference: The course definition is more structured in its description of the tinkering process, emphasizing:\nThe progression from undirected play to goal-driven experimentation. The role of trial-and-error as a fundamental method. The influence of serendipity rather than strict structure. What aspects does the answer miss? The AI definition does not state that tinkering can also be done with a goal in mind. The AI definition also misses the broad settings in which Tinkering can be used. The AI states it as an approach to learn and problem solve while the course talks about it being a mindset.\nQuestion 2 The project I have chosen is the Smirnoff - Mindtunes project [3] in which they use Brain Computer Interfacing to make music. This is done to give people who are tetraplegic the opportunity to be creative and make music together using only their brains. They transform emotion into brainwaves and then into sounds waves to make a song together.\nThe 5 technical hurdles the project faced are:\nSensor accuracy Controlling thoughts Connecting all three persons to different instruments with their emotions controlling different parts of the music Noise in the BCI data Calibrating to each individual Question 3 I would go hunting for tinkerspiration at these physical and online places:\nPhysical:\nAbility Tech FabLabs Makerspaces Designlab Museums Online:\nThingiverse Instructables Instagram YouTube Arduino Project Hub I have gotten inspiration from a lot of YouTube videos and made projects which were available on Thingiverse. I have found multiple project on Thingiverse which are still on my bucket list and to be made list. For example completing the InMoov [4] robot which can be seen in the image below.\nQuestion 4 The 5 domains, challenges or setting I would like to apply tinkering in are:\nAssitive technology Why? Designing accessible personalized products for people with a disability. It is a way of coming up with small ideas that can improve the daily life of a person with a disability dramatically. For example a 3D printed part which can hold down greens on the counter for a person which is able to use one hand. Music Why? To create alternative ways to create music. For example the Smirnoff mindtunes, so giving someone who is not able to hold a physical instrument the change to still play music. Public transport Why? Public transport is constantly searching for improvements but the tracks are not easy to change so tinkering can mean something for the world around the tracks. For example changing the inside of a train with ambient lights or different seating options that create a welcoming and nice feeling and next to that to create interactive things at the stations waiting rooms. Student housing Why? Tinkering could be used to see what students would come up with for their own house and thus tailor a house to their needs. Since they are students they might come up with crazy ideas for which they are able to test them themselves since they often do research. For example a ideas to creative ideas to create more spacee in a small room. Mental health Why? People can come up with everything they want which can work therapeutic since a person is able to let go off all their thoughts and stress because they focus on doing something with their hands. For example for a person with autism to make something that expresses their emotions. The sweetspots are in domains where a person is able to constantly change and thus iterate on ideas. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are untinkerable domains since it can always give ideas but in the medicine world it would be dangerous to use medicines that have not been tested. So it is also important that there are no risks or certain restrictions to tinkering in a domain.\nReferences\nCambridge University Press. (n.d.). Cambridge Dictionary.

It creates a physical appearance which people trust and gets attention. Other shapes that exist are HoloLens and Meta Quest which are avatars that move in the space around us but do not have a physical body. Next to that AR/VR and holograms are rising in which virtual agents are projected into the physical world.\nRobotic Capabilities and Social Aspects Robotic capabilities and social aspects are not the same since they differ in focus. Robotic/engineering capabilities focusses on what the robot is able to do and how the robot executes the functions while social aspects is more focussed on how the robot comes across to humans. Social aspects is more focussed on interaction while the focus of robotic capabilities is on performance.\nInsights on dealing in a structured way with the robotic capabilities and social aspects of the design are:\nThe Function–Behavior–Structure (FBS) Framework from J. S. Gero and U. Kannengiesser [1], can help to create a division between functions, behaviors and structures to map social goals to design features. The Interaction Design Framework from J. Forlizzi and S. Ford [2], can help understand and design user experiences in interactive systems. It shows three perspective on experiences and components influencing the experience. Through looking at the components influencing the experience we can make a division between different part in social robot design. The components are product characteristics, user characteristics and interaction context. Next to the components there are also qualities of experience which are stated: satisfying, enjoyable, engaging and meaningful. By understanding the relationship between product attributes, user characteristics and context, designers can predict and influence the quality of the user experience. Yes, we can write social interaction requirements for robots in a clear and organized way, just like we do for technical or engineering tasks. This helps make social behaviors easier to understand, measure and test even though they often feel unclear or hard to define.\nA template for these requirements made with chatgpt [3] can be found below.\nRequirement ID Type Description Criteria for Success Method of Verification SI-001 Social Responsiveness Robot must greet a person within 2 seconds of face detection Time ≤ 2 sec after detection Interaction log, real-time testing SI-002 Emotion Expression Robot must express “confusion” when it fails to understand a command Visual cue (tilted head), audio cue Observation Examples of Conflicts and Opportunities Examples of conflicts that arise in the function defines form vs social requirements are:\nAssistive robot for elderly care: from the functional side it must be very functional and usable while on the social side it needs to look approachable and provide a comforting feel for an elderly. The conflict is in creating a purely functional device will not work for elderly since they will not trust it. Industrial robot arm: from the functional side it must be very efficient, precise and work with speed while on the social side it needs to appear safe and that people can approach the robot and do not need to keep a very big distance. The conflict is mostly in that fast and powerful movements of the arm can seem unsafe and threatening for people that need to work with them. Example of a design that is a very good match is a soft robotic in therapy for example the Paro Robot Seal. In this way the soft and cuddly appearance of the seal supports the function of it providing emotional suport and social bonding. Next to that the movement is slow and gentle which aligns the function of emotional support with the social need of comfort and trust.\nDuffy\u0026rsquo;s Embodiment Reference Duffy (see below) formulated a nice reference list of aspects relevant for design of embodiment. Which of these are the most relevant for your case?\nThe most relevant aspects for design of embodiment according to Duffy [4] are:\nPrinciple Explanation Use social conventions and communication in function and form Design robots to communicate in ways familiar to humans, both in appearance and behavior. Avoid the uncanny valley Steer clear of designs that look almost but not quite human, which can cause discomfort or eeriness. Use natural (fluent) motion Ensure robot movements are smooth and lifelike to foster better social engagement. Balance function and form Make sure the robot’s appearance aligns with and supports its functional goals. Balance anthropomorphism and function Use human-like features thoughtfully to enhance interaction without compromising utility. Allow the robot to portray identity Enable robots to have distinct personalities or characters to help users relate to them. Make sure artificial emotions do not obstruct interaction Avoid overly complex or inappropriate emotional expressions that confuse or hinder communication. All of these principles can be very useful in the tool that we created and can be added as an extra guiding card.\nReferences [1] J. S. Gero and U.

As stated in the paper \u0026ldquo;By prioritizing the quality and communicative properties of movement over pragmatic function or aesthetic form, we can give proper attention to the importance of movement in human communication and perception.\u0026rdquo;, before the lesson I did not know how important motion was to express emotions. During the lecture it became clear that even using a simple waterbottle and putting a piece of paper around that, already is able to show some form of emotion. Next to that I was more focussed on the actual expression of a face to express emotion and now knowing that motion is a big key factor makes it very interesting to see what you can achieve without a face or eyes. Also the lesson about using more non-antromorphic robots shows how if we do not give a robot certain human-like features the attribution of emotions is different. Since we perchieve them not as human-like and creates a cognitive dissonance however, I find it very fascinating to combine non-antromorphic robot and motion to see how well emotion can be perceived even tho they are not directly expressed. I also think that using the Wizard of Oz technique a lot of emotions or expressions can be tested which would be nice to use in our own case.\nLaban Framework \u0026amp; Alternatives The Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) framework is a structured system for understanding and describing human movement [1]. H. Knight et al. [2] used the framework to develop a set of motion features to analyze and eventually generate expressive movements in robots, mostly focussed on robot with a limited degrees of freedom. From the study it became clear that LMA principles can enhance expressiveness of robots especially in a play where non-verbal cues are used in the interaction. A. LaViers et al. also used the LMA framework to provide a non-verbal embodied vocabulary for designing robot motion that feels meaningful or intentional to humans. An important point from the study is that the LMA framework allowed the designers to create expressive movement without needing to anthropomorphize the robot.\nOne alternative to Laban is the Legibility Evaluation that is used by S. Wallkötter et al. [4], it is focussed on evaluating how understandable robot actions are and what the robot is doing and why. It is more an evalution of robots compared to Laban which is focussed on creating expressive motion.\nLaban is the main route since it can be used both to analyze human motion and generate robot motion. Every discipline is able to use this framework to create expressive motion for robots in a non-humanoid form.\nDesigning Movement to Achieve Intentionality The main part of the statement is about that a robot doesn\u0026rsquo;t need to behave like a human, it just needs to act in a way that humans can interpret as intentional. For this I would use a combination of the above mentioned approaches namely Laban and Motion Legibility to focus on creating understandable expressive motion.\nSound Design and Haptics as Means for Expression For sound design the auditory icons/earcons can be used in social robots to communicate an intention or emotion through a sound. Auditory icons are real-world sounds that have a semantic, intuitive link to the event they represent and earcons are abstract, musical or synthetic tones that follow a structured logic, like a system of beeps or motifs [5].\nFor haptics the Tactons/tactile icons framework [6] can be used in social robots to create vibration patterns or tactile cues to communicate expressions non-virtually. They are analogous to the earcons but then in the tactile domain. Touch patterns are mapped to meanings using: frequency, amplitude, duration, rhythm and location [6]. Manipulating these parameters creates different types of tactile messages.\nDesign Space of a anti-Social Robot The design space of an anti-social robot would be to create environments in which the robot behaves in a way that does not contribute to humans. It can focus on the relationship we want with robots and challenge our assumptions made about robots when for example a robot is being rude. It can show a completely different side to social interaction with a robot. Next to that it can also be helpful to create only functional robot that do not need social interaction.\nReferences [1] \u0026ldquo;Laban movement analysis,\u0026rdquo; Wikipedia, May 9, 2024.

As stated in the paper \u0026ldquo;By prioritizing the quality and communicative properties of movement over pragmatic function or aesthetic form, we can give proper attention to the importance of movement in human communication and perception.\u0026rdquo;, before the lesson I did not know how important motion was to express emotions. During the lecture it became clear that even using a simple waterbottle and putting a piece of paper around that, already is able to show some form of emotion. Next to that I was more focussed on the actual expression of a face to express emotion and now knowing that motion is a big key factor makes it very interesting to see what you can achieve without a face or eyes. Also the lesson about using more non-antromorphic robots shows how if we do not give a robot certain human-like features the attribution of emotions is different. Since we perchieve them not as human-like and creates a cognitive dissonance however, I find it very fascinating to combine non-antromorphic robot and motion to see how well emotion can be perceived even tho they are not directly expressed. I also think that using the Wizard of Oz technique a lot of emotions or expressions can be tested which would be nice to use in our own case.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Reflective Questions Session 3: Expression"},{"content":"Session 1: Design Tools I was not present during this session and recevied no input from my group.\nSession 2: Story Building During the session we first used the Design Tools for Innovation to categorize them as tools that could be usefull for creating scenarios. In the picture below our division can be found.\nExisting Scenario Tools We started by making a quick overview of the tools that were in the assignment with ChatGPT to use as a starting point for choosing the scenario tools. It provided the following overview of various scenario tools with their strengths and weaknesses.\nTool Description Strengths Weaknesses Scripts Written dialogues or interactions between the user and the product Fast, intuitive, and focuses on flow Can miss spatial/contextual detail Storyboards Sequential images showing interaction moments Visual highlights emotion Time-consuming, may oversimplify Play-Acting / Role Play Acting out a scenario with/without props Embodied, real-time feedback Needs group participation, may feel awkward Stop Motion / Animation Mini-films that illustrate scenarios Engaging, repeatable, remote-friendly Requires some media skills Cards (e.g. IDEO Method Cards) Prompts or building blocks for scenario creation Quick, accessible Can feel generic without customisation Digital Tools: Storyboard That, Miro, Figma, Twine Tools for scripting, visual layout, and branching interaction Flexible, collaborative Can be overwhelming or not tailored to robot-specific needs Proposed Scenario Tool With the options in mind we soon made the decision the combine scripts and cards since they were the ones that stood out to us. After choosing these tools we searched for scientific articles about how these tools are grounded and wrote a text about this.\nFrom the research it became clear that Xu et al. [1] identified several challenges with scenario-based evaluation in the field of Human Robot Interaction (HMI). These challenges include the confidence of participants with the used media, so paper paper-based tools or digital media (videos). Another problem is the lack of interactivity, which leads to a failure to capture the dynamic relationship of human–robot interactions. Scenarios also often fail to include the dynamic real-world situations, missing details and adaptability to these situations. Scenarios might fail to represent social and emotional cues in live interactions, which are of great importance in assessing human-robot interaction.\nTo account for these limitations, the decision was made to combine scripts with a set of prompt cards. The script can be an empty template, with lines for the robot and the human the robot interacts. This allows participants to design the scenario, turn by turn, which is similar to real conversations. The prompt cards will include different personas, locations, actions and emotions. Based on these cards, the script will be written, providing a scenario that can provide various insights.\nOne of the limitations mentioned is the dynamic real-world conversations. In real life, people often wait for their turns instead of talking over each other. Robots use this turn-based logic, and using scripts as a scenario-building tool will mimic this. In scripts, clear planning of responses and events is used. Mateas and Stern [2] use scripting to manage difficult and real-time interaction between users and AI characters. This work shows how scripting can make human-computer interaction dynamic and use emotions.\nTo support this, Murray and Maher [3] explore how trajectories in interactive narratives can help structure and develop behaviour-focused human-computer systems. By leveraging these principles in Human Robot Interaction, the proposed tool encourages thinking about how interactions evolve over time, not solely as isolated events.\nDeveloping a Scenario for the Chosen Tools On the left side of the tool in yellow, there will be a pile of described input cards that can help build or prompt the script. To the right, you can see the templates for the script, which can be filled in while using the input cards. A benefit of this tool is that you can easily mimic and create real-life applications and determine what would work and what wouldn’t work. In both scenario’s the tool helped structure dynamic conversations between humans and robots, leveraging a turn-taking model. The use of prompt cards ensures variety and helps steer the conversation so that it is not a completely random script. The visual layout helped us in collaborating as a team, the collaboration helped identify gaps or unrealistic responses. This tool is specifically designed for relevant storytelling in Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) by offering a structured, collaborative environment to simulate and evaluate interactive scenarios between humans and robots.\nOne of the limitations of this tool is creating fully realistic emotional responses. This requires more nuanced input cards. This could be achieved by acting out the scenarios or providing this script as inspiration for something like improv theatre. The tool for now is focused on shorter narratives and quickly discovering if an application of a robot would seem logical or not. For future development, longer or evolving narratives, potentially with branching, would be needed to create more realistic stories. An addition that can be made is conflict cards, to introduce problems or tension, maybe even potential problems that can arise from interaction with the robot. This could help design scenarios that overcome these design problems. ‘Wild’ cards can also be added to involve unexpected events, to stimulate speculative thinking, and to design with the unexpected in mind.\nSession 3: Expression Paper-prop-puppeteering description and observations of simple paper-prop-puppeteering\nWe tried to express emotions using a water bottle since we felt like this object does not express emotions. We taped of any visible images/cues, to limit any influence on the emotions. Our goal was to show emotions through movements with the water bottle. We were able to create several emotions with simple movements. The emotions we used are:\nEmotion 1: Happy, water bottle turning upside down and spinning Emotion 2: Sad, waterbottle rolling on the side, slowly Emotion 3: Neutral, water bottle standing normally Emotion 4: Surprised, waterbottle goes through the air/is thrown into the air Emotion 5: Disgusted, water bottle falls on its side Emotion 6: Uninterested, turning the water bottle away Emotion 1 Emotion 2 Emotion 3 Emotion 4 Emotion 5 Emotion 6 How fast the bottle is turning, rolling, thrown into the air etc. helps express how intense the emotion is.\nWhen translating these movements the aspects that work are uninterested, neutral, happy, sad. The turning of the bottle is difficult to put into a robot like ROSE since it then needs a lot of space and is then constantly turning around.\nCombining our motion with rose shows that the different emotions can be expressed in different ways:\nNeutral can be just a standing/resting pose Uninterested can be turning the head away Sad tilting the head forward and looking to the ground Happy head held high Surprised is too difficult since you need more of a lifting emotion and that is not possible Disgusted is also difficult since letting robot collapse is not possible Expressiveness Tool The Care-Tension Cards + Improv Stage toolkit was made to help designers figure out how social robots can show their feelings and intentions in a respectful and clear way when working with older adults. It helps solve the problem of making robot behaviors that balance being independent, respecting dignity, and meeting care needs. Using realistic situations and limits, the toolkit combines role-playing with different ways robots can express themselves. This helps designers understand which robot actions are right, acceptable, and easy to understand during real care situations.\nInstructions The exercise aims to determine what expressive features the robot design would require in the broad application of elderly care. It is inspired by our scenario-building tool, but now focuses on improv theatre. It helps designers understand which and how expressive behaviour affects acceptance, clarity and comfort in elderly care scenarios. The toolkit involves improv theatre rules, props and elderly care scenario cards.\nCards in the toolkit The toolkit consists of three type of cards:\nScenario cards: \u0026ldquo;The resident refuses to eat but seems low energy. The robot needs to act.\u0026rdquo; These contain the setting and/or information for the improv theatre scene. These include real-life elderly care situations, or can be developed for specific applications. This can also be done with the scenario building tool that was developed last week. Conflict cards: Autonomy vs. safety / frustration vs. help / dignity vs. routine These cards help define the care tension in the scenario. Constraint cards: Use sound effects / No speech / limited motion The constraint cards limit the expressive modalities allowed for the robot. Multiple constrains can be used, to test out several variations of a design. Improv theatre rules The toolkit is used in rounds, each round requires at least three participants. One person plays the elder/user, one person the robot, and the last person is the observer.\nIt is allowed to include props, these can include the following:\nSmall speaker to initiate sound effects Different textiles: plush, or harder metal materials Phone / tablets to help act out certain scenarios General home objects, depending on the setting of the scenarios With these props and additional tools, the facilitator and actors need to keep in mind the limitations of the limitation card. A scene should not last too long, but it is up to the facilitator to end a scene.\nSession 4: Embodiment Usage of Pepper and Nao Yes, a majority of social robotics research still uses Pepper and NAO. These robots are widely available, easy to program, and supported by a strong developer community. While newer robots like Furhat, QTrobot, and ARI are emerging, we believe after looking at some projects that Pepper and NAO remain the majority in many studies, not because they\u0026rsquo;re ideal for every task, but simply because they\u0026rsquo;re accessible and versatile. Despite Pepper\u0026rsquo;s limited commercial success, it’s still heavily used in labs and experiments.\nTotal Freedom over the Embodiment and Suitability and Matrix If we were to have total freedom over the embodiment, the robots would be better adapted to the context in which they operate. If it better fits the needs and requirements of the context/environment, it can lead to richer interactions with the robot. The form of the robot seems to define the function in social robotics. The problem with Pepper/Nao is that it is a generalised robot that can function in various environments, without necessarily adapting its embodiment. This can lead to a mismatch in size with the user group, either too small or too big. Pepper \u0026amp; Nao also have limited mobility, limited facial expression, and the humanoid look is leaning towards the uncanny valley for some users. If possibilities were endless, embodiments should include more non-humanoid shapes. In addition, the size should match the environment in which they are used. So, use smaller robots for things like tabletop learning, and bigger robots for transportational functionalities.\nWith all these things in mind we created a matrix for all the robots that were seen during the lecture:\nFeature/Robot Clicbot DJI Robomaster S1 Miko 2 Robot Robot Cat (VibraPurr) mTiny Robot Winky Robot Anki Vector Roybi Robot EMO Picture Size Small Small battlebot-like Small Small Small Small and round Small Small Small Shape Toy-like, modular Toy-like, tank-like Toy-like, rounded Animal, cat-like Toy-like, cube Toy-like, circular head Compact, cube-shaped Toy-like, rounded Toy-like, humanoid-like Colour White and grey Black and grey Blue and white White, grey, beige White with accents Blue, red, white Black with screen face White and pink Black with LED face Face One-eyed face screen No face Screen with two eyes \u0026ldquo;Miauw\u0026rdquo; face Two panda eyes, drawn mouth Screen with two eyes Screen with two eyes Round screen Screen with color-changing eyes Mobility Wheels, can move like a worm Moves with wheels Small wheels Moves paws, rotates body Small wheels Wheels, moves head and ears Moves with wheels, interacts Static Walks and dances on two legs Emotion Expression Voice, screen, movement Not really, but can shoot Expresses emotions (various) Moves, purrs, \u0026ldquo;miauws\u0026rdquo; Facial expressions, movement Eyes, sound, movement Eyes, sound, movement Voice and eye expressions Dances, eyes, sound effects Context STEM education, coding Competitive robotics Child learning \u0026amp; fun Elder companionship Preschool coding Child entertainment Home assistant Language learning Home companion Expectation Match High (creativity, coding) High (remote-controlled action) Moderate to high (kids) High (pet replacement) High (early education) Moderate (fun-focused) Moderate Moderate (education focus) Moderate (novelty, companion) Developing an Embodiment Design Tool As idea we came up with a card game in which players use cards that represent real robot features. The features that are represented are appearance, capabilities, personality traits and contexts. The card game aims to build a robot that best fits the challenge.\nThe card types used are:\nCard Type Description Examples Form Cards (blue) Physical traits: size, shape, material, color Small \u0026amp; Round, Soft Animal, Transparent Casing Function Cards (green) Capabilities: movement, sensors, expressions Wheels + Head Rotation, Facial Recognition, LED Eye Display Emotion Cards (red) Emotional expressions, personality traits Playful Voice, Shy Posture, Purring Sound Context Cards (yellow) Usage scenarios Hospital Room, Preschool Class, Home Office Challenge Cards (black) Design briefs that drive gameplay A robot to help anxious children, A guide in a noisy museum How to Play\nStep 1: Draw a Challenge Card\nExample: “Design a robot for calming patients in a waiting room.” Step 2: Each player builds a robot\nChoose 1 Form, 2 Function, 1 Emotion, and 1 Context card. Players can use real robot examples (Clicbot, Pepper, Vector, etc.) for inspiration printed on each card (or drawn randomly). Step 3: Describe and pitch your robot\nGive your robot a name, describe how it looks, acts, and why it fits the challenge. Use storytelling or a sketch to present. Step 4: Vote or Judge\nPlayers vote on the most creative, functional, or emotionally appropriate robot design. Sources [1] Q. Xu, J. Ng, O. Tan, Z. Huang, B. Tay, and T.

With the three categories more subcategories can be made in which the main ones are combined.\nMoral dilemmas in which real-world problems are challenged by robots/AI Reshaping humans and society through telling stories about changing human identity or society in general with robots/AI Emotional support in which robots/AI have roles in which they are like a friend or companion to a human Dystopian stories in which fears that currently exist about robots/AI are blown up and become true such as taking over the world Utopian stories in which the world can be saved by robots/AI and they are praised contradicting the dystopian stories Johnson B.D. Approach and Differences Johnson introduced Science Fiction Prototyping as a method to imagine and explore future technologies through storytelling. Johnson advocates the following five step process for writing Science Fiction Prototypes:\nPick Your Science and Build Your World Identify the Scientific Inflection Point Consider ramifications of the Science on People Identify the Human Inflection Point Reflect on what Did We Learn? The difference between Science Fiction Prototyping (SFP) and Generic Scenario-Based Design (SBD) is that SFP uses storytelling to understand and change the human experience with future technologies while SBD develops specific use cases to inform design decisions and usability. Next to that they are also different in outcome since SBD tries to improve the functionality or user experience of a product and SFP on the other hand is more about opening up a discussion and reflecting on implications that future technologies might have. SFP is more broad and about what the future can bring while SBD is specific and practical.\n21st Century Robot Project and NOA-like Personality The 21st Century Robot project aimed to create a customizable, open-source robot platform. The robot became NAO-like since the robot had predictable behavior since all the tasks and interactions were scripted. Next to that the robot had a friendly appearance which made it look very approachable and non-threatening. Choosing different storytelling or design approaches could have led to a robot which was not looking friendly and no full control of the interaction but could be more dynamic.\nStorytelling in Consumer Robotics Consumer robots are often marketed as friendly, being a companion and being intelligent. These stories can differ from reality since robots often lack real intelligence, autonomy and emotions. But also often do not have all the features that are being told about since they are technically unachievable. The stories often disappoint users and are misleading.\nStorytelling Considerations in SRD The storytelling aspects which you should consider when designing social robots are:\nBackstories: A background story for a robot can help create relatability and connection. Personality: Creating a robot that has well-defined and consistent personality features helps users to predict the behavior of the robot Roles: Stating which purpose and capabilities the robot has makes sure that users expectations align with the robot functionalities. The uncanny valley is where entities that closely resemble humans but are not quite lifelike, elicit discomfort. This can be linked to the story since a difference in appearance and behavior of the robot can create a dissonance for users which can cause discomfort for users.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/socialrobotdesign/reflectionweek2/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"categorisation-for-robotai-stories\"\u003eCategorisation for Robot/AI stories\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe categorisation I can come up with for Robot/AI stories is that you can divide them into three main categories namely themes, purposes and emotional response.

Using a multidisciplinary approach and gathering projects from different fields to make social robots Assessing humanoid factors through: discussing the level of intuitiveness of an artifact; describing the interaction channels of the artifact from the viewpoint of the pragmatic of human communication; measuring the face-ism index of the artifact; defining the position of the artifact in the uncanny valley diagram Designing a robotic interface is complex due to lack of standards and it being in development stages in which it is difficult to combine all the different tech parts Importance of having a face as interface that is intuitive and familiar for people to have an interaction Engaging users in design leads to more relevant and accepted social robot designs in the case of InMoov, iCub and Ono. Chapter 9 Embodiment vs Digital Content The general statements that can be made regarding embodiment vs ditigal content are:\nA mobile phone can be seen as a social robot since they provoke strong emotional responses and create bonds with people even though they do not have a very much physical embodiment of a social robot since they only consist out of a screen and haptic feedback Creating an emotional connection with people is done through personalized content and not through physical interaction Currently a lot of people are already addicted to their screen which means that they adapted to screens and do not always need a human face to interact with something. We do not always need actuators because people are able to attribute personality and emotion to for example a phone in which only digital interaction is used\nThe parts of embodiment that turn a smartphone into a social robot are:\nA personality that stays the same Changing behavior Giving feedback Timing when to say what Able to understand context My perspective after watching \u0026lsquo;Her\u0026rsquo; In the movie \u0026lsquo;her\u0026rsquo; the embodiment is not really present since Samantha does not have a body however still the relationship can be felt through the connection she creates. This is done through having certain rituals, being responsive, having a memory and also having a voice. This gives Samantha a character which can be seen by a human and changes the look for me from an actual robot that is social to creating an interaction which has certain features from which a human can sense trust and familiarity.\nVincent vs Bar-Cohen When comparing the focus of Vincent with Bar-Cohen it becomes clear that Vincent focuses on the cultural, ethical and psychological dimensions of human-robot interaction while Bar-Cohen is more optimistic and looks at the use of technology to make humanoids acceptable in different types of fields such as the healthcare and a household.\nThe real-world deviated from the predicted revolution since humanoid robots are still not very acceptable since they are too complex and expensive but also unnecessary for many tasks. People are very much focussed on their privacy and stand up against the ethical challenges that arise with social robots. The social acceptance is still low and slowed down the integration of robots in everyday life. However another type of robot became popular which are the smart assistants such as Alexa and Siri.\nRobot Hotel The robot hotel was a hotel which promised automation through using humanoid robots when comparing the robot hotel with the CitizenM hotel which uses automation it becomes clear that the focus of the robot hotel was wrong. They failed since their UX was not strong enough to keep guests away from usability issues and frustration. The humanoid robots were too annoying and often broke down which was not worth the trouble. They tried making different robots for a lot of different features which could easily be handled by people themselves. The robot should add functional or emotional value and that was not the case it only created trouble.\nNabaztag Rabbit Nabaztag is a communicating object in the shape of a rabit, it had a sort of personality which had ears, lights and speech. It fits the definition of a social robot since it tries to have a personality with emotional responses and a physical interface. It was not successfull due to the use of the robot being very unclear, responsiveness was not that great and it depended on the network which did not work great and was technically fragile in general. The design was ahead of its time but the emotional connection was not there enough and prove unsuccessful.\nCuddlebits Paper The key insights in the role and application of design research in the Cuddlebits projects are:\nMinimal robots which can show different emotions Building emotions from rhythm, haptics and expectations Helps make clear the feelings people had about about the robot and the trustworthiness Focussing on legibility of emotions through subtle movements and engaging users through adapting to robots behavior ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/socialrobotdesign/reflectionweek1/","summary":"\u003ch2 id=\"pointers-from-social-robots-from-a-human-perspective-chapter-8\"\u003ePointers from Social Robots from a Human Perspective Chapter 8\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe pointers from chapter 8 include:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eSharing robot projects open-source encourages people to make their own social robot and broaden the field of social robotics but also make robots more accessible.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eUsing a multidisciplinary approach and gathering projects from different fields to make social robots\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eAssessing humanoid factors through: discussing the level of intuitiveness of an artifact; describing the interaction channels of the artifact from the viewpoint of the\npragmatic of human communication; measuring the face-ism index of the artifact; defining the position of the artifact in the uncanny valley diagram\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eDesigning a robotic interface is complex due to lack of standards and it being in development stages in which it is difficult to combine all the different tech parts\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eImportance of having a face as interface that is intuitive and familiar for people to have an interaction\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEngaging users in design leads to more relevant and accepted social robot designs in the case of InMoov, iCub and Ono.\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"chapter-9-embodiment-vs-digital-content\"\u003eChapter 9 Embodiment vs Digital Content\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe general statements that can be made regarding embodiment vs ditigal content are:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Reflective Questions Session 1: Design Tools"},{"content":"Week 2 Session Brainstorm We started the assignment by doing a little brainstorm in which we came up with ideas that were closed to our interests. From our first selection of problems, we picked the unintuitiveness of cars; how hard it is to know what is wrong with one without training and/or extensive documentation / help. Rationale; tinkering mindset to make something technically difficult accessible.\nDuring the brainstorm we made some sketches on a whiteboard The two ideas that came from the brainstorm were:\nEducation kit for cars Many people, especially children, grow up without a basic understanding of how car engines work, making regular car maintenance and unexpected roadside issues difficult to handle. The solution: A kit that you can give to children (or adults) that gives them an intuition for the parts present in a car. VR kit A VR kit that shows people what they can find under the hood of a car. Pitches We pitched these two ideas and received feedback about the feasibility of the ideas. The mindset and type of idea was really fitting for a tinkering session. However, since making these ideas would mean that we would go big which would be difficult to make in real-life. We got a tip to look more into the Invento kits since it would be building materials that have the same scale as our ideas. We could use this as part of our scaffolding materials which would be given out during our tinkering session. Next to that we received the feedback that our workshop was too little open-ended and would turn more into a teaching session instead of a tinkering one.\nAfter the pitches we increased our tinkerability through refining our scope to the concept of energy transformation specifically a combustion engine which translates pressure into movement. We wanted to let kids explore the concept of pressure and to turn it into motion and/or direction. The general goal was to let people explore mechanical mechanisms. One the ideas was to give two (or more) translating motors and some other materials to people for a workshop. The goal is to turn the translating movement into a rotating movement and do something cool with it (among the materials will be wheels, propellers and other cool rotating stuff).\nOur main technical hurdle in this phase was the difficulty of creating an actually working piston + crankshaft system. Our building block would be this component, and through a life-size scale this building block would have an inviting affordance, allowing participants to transform muscle force to pressure to movement. A wide range of other components would be supplied so that participants could then use this movement to create whatever they deemed cool.\nSketches of translating wind into motion We used this idea and pitched it again, after reflecting we realised that, though the idea was nice. The building blocks we had thought up would be very hard to realise within the scope of this course. So we made another switch, this time not necessarily for tinkerability\u0026rsquo;s sake, but so that the concept would become something we could realise. We kept the theme of energy transfer but made it more feasible by switching from pistons to sails. We chose this idea since most of our group members have experience with windsurfing and know how the wind is transformed into movement. Next to that most of have handy materials laying around or access to surfing materials so ideas could easily be realised. In addition, this idea requires less precision in the materials used, pistons need to be airtight for example. This meant that prototyping was more forgiving and easy to make different models. A downside to this idea is that the workshop is difficult to do without the wind and thus very reliant on the wind conditions.\nSession Design Work After thinking out the idea we tried making a division between pre-designed parts and what to leave to be tinkered with. the first idea was to make a pre-made sail which we give to the people as building block. They were able to make their own surfboard or boat or skateboard on which the sail can be attached. This again meant that the workshop was not really open-ended that is why we changed to a different building block. We tried making it open-ended through letting people build their own sail and surfboard/skateboard in the workshop. People are able to create many different sail types and boards which can be used to translate wind into motion. People can choose between making something that can be used on land and in water. People should be able to do whatever they want to do with the materials we provide to harness the wind. However we do want to provide some building blocks which make it easier to build a sail.\nThese building blocks make sure users can quickly and easily carry out their ideas in a physical way. The blocks take care of that the sail cloth can be easily attached to a mast, a mast can be easily mounted to their board and that a sail frame can be made. We thus need to design connectors for attaching rods/masts to each other and the structure and a way to easily attach sail cloth to those rods\nPrototyping We started designing and making preliminary design for the three building blocks. As first step we chose a PVC pipe from designlab which we were going to be using for the rods. We chose fo PVC pipes since they are easy to use and cheap. We tried making the sail cloth connector and rod connector with a 3d printer since our first idea was to make it with TPU which can be done on a 3D printer. Next to that protoyping with a 3d printer is accessible and cheap especially since a group member has a 3d printer.\nThere are three different types of building blocks with each different iteration cycles.\nSail cloth connector Is used to connect the sail cloth to the rods The sail cloth that we used are old surfing kites which were broken and were otherwise thrown in the bin. We used them since they are lightweight, reasonably sturdy and accessible to us. To connect the cloth to the rods we had multiple iterations. In version 1 we used old rubber bicycle handlebars, we cut them open and fitted them around the rod to which the sail was connected. Since it is made out of rubber it was very grippy on the sail. It worked okay ish but since the rubber was flexible the connector came of way too easily when pressure was used. In version 2 we used a corrugation tube which makes it a bit too unflexible to easily clip on but makes for a more snug fit. The material of the tubes hard/smooth so there was not enough grip, that is when we decided to make our own sail cloth connector with a 3d printer.\nSail cloth clip versions After printing and changing dimensions ten times we got a clip that was snapping onto the pipe and not coming of too easily. Next to the sailclip we tried making a clip that could be tie down with a rope.\nSail cloth clip 3d printed Rod connector Is used to connect different rods together to create a frame Rod connector sketches The first idea was to make the rod connectors flexible so they could be easily bended and make the frame of the sail. After sketching out some ideas we tried modelling and 3d printing them to see if they would work. The clips on the left have a rope which make sure you can tie down the rod so they will not go off easily. However when modelling the sketch we came to the conclusion that when you connect the rods in the connectors they would be aligned horizontally, this does not help making a shape for a sail. The rods needs to be connected in different angles and lining up horizontally to create a shape. To connect the rods in the most simple way in an angle we made the second sketch in a model. Since the dimensions of the rod were known it was easy to create and 3d print this shape. It worked nicely but the downside to this model is that the angle is not able to rotate and the connector needs to be slided onto the frame. This creates restrictions in easily creating different shapes. After that we tried 3d printing with TPU but this could not be done with the 3d printed available to one of the group members. We still wanted to create a connector that had different angles.\nRod connector models That is why we tried to use a model closely related to the sail cloth clip. This model has some requirements namely to change the angle and connecting the rods in any place. After sketching, an idea came up and this idea was 3d printed. The idea was to make two differnt parts which had magnets attached. One part is a bigger version of the sail clip and the other is a block which can be changed to a block that has different angels. This makes it easy to connect them in different angels and change things up when needed. When testing the prototype it became clear that when force was applied the magnets would not be strong enough to keep the two parts together and thus create a frame for the sail. In the next steps we only used the rigid 90 degree angle connector.\nRod connector improved model During the testing of our workshop and gathering material we cam across multiple difficulties. One of the difficulties was that when searching for more rods it became clear that we had chosen a PVC pipe which was not a standard dimension. After going to a lot of different stores we chose a standard dimension and added foam around it so the clips that were made were still able to fit around the pipe tightly. This made the pipes less rigid, but we were able to use the same clips without needing to print new ones. Also an advantage was that now the dimensions were not that strict so we were able to use all of the prototypes of the clips and did not needed to print more.\nRod problems Baseplate Is used to connect the mast with the board For the baseplate multiple sketches and a model were made. However, when getting the rods it became clear that the baseplate was not needed anymore. The existing windsurfing baseplates were able to fit perfectly into the rods and it thus became redundant. To connect the rods with the baseplate more sturdy we added holes to the pipes so they can be attached to mast feet with a piece of rope. We made sketches for creating different baseplates to connect to different boards but during the testing we used a mountainboard board which has a baseplate and we did not worked this out further.\nNext to the prototypes we made cards which we can show to people to give them idea about what type of sail to build. Pictures of these cards can be found on the poster.\nFor the testing we brought a lot of old kites, scissors, knives and ropes so people were able to make their own sail. We tested with group member who did not have knowledge about sail and she was able to build her own sail according to the idea she had. It worked out nicely and made more sails during the demo day. Below an overview of the sail that were made can be found.\nShowing the sails! As an overview of the project the poster can be found below.

You are constantly focussing on how things fit together and can be changed. It also has big impact on being scared to try stuff out, you are constantly doing things and mostly exploring with your hands which removes this anxiety.\nTinkering with digital and electronic media Tinkering with digital and electronic media adds some form of interaction since often sensors or microcontrollers are used which are able to provide some form of feedback. It also combines the physical world with the computing world to create something. Coding is also open-ended however there are some rules or syntax which must be used in order to get it working.\nReproducibility in tinkering Reproducing something is often done through using documentation, this is something which can be made but is often about the result. While in tinkering the process is often way more important. You are more focussed on exploring than making something reproducible. When you are tinkering often you end up changing a lot of things around the way and just trying stuff out. When a result of that is documented it does not teach the same lessons. Tinkering is more about adapting as you go than about making something reproducible.\nIterative prototyping and tinkering cycles Tinkering is often open-ended where as prototyping is mostly done with a specific goal in mind. Prototypes are often tested and improved to get the best version. In tinkering the process is the most important and the ability to explore different things. I do think however that it is not black and white and that tinkering and prototyping are often overlapping.\nCo-design as tinkering session I think a co-design session can be described as a tinkering session when it has certain features. Most importantly the co-design session must be hands-on, open-ended and exploratory to fit the tinkering principle. Next to that the support/facilitator in a co-design session must be focussed on helping people sharing, trying and also failing.\nInfluence of materials in a co-design session I think the results can be influenced since there are many types of materials which result in different outcomes. For exmaple using cardboard encourages people to take risks and be really hands-on. If the material provided is less valuable there will be different outcomes compared to using an Arduino kit. The materials can influence the outcomes but do not always control the outcomes since people use them and do the things they want. This can not be predicted up front by choosing a certain type of material. I think the influencing the outcome with the type of materials is nice since people can be pushed into a certain direction to create certain outcomes. Next to that it is also not very nice since you want to give people the ability to choose the direction they want to go in.\nTinkering in research through design I think tinkering in research through design can fill in the design part since it shows people many different options through creating designs. Not only differnt options but also why they do or do not work and how people can interact with them. It helps to solve problems in a hands-on way.\nUntinkerable design questions I think there are quite some design questions in which tinkering it not really possible. These situations do not have an open end or use strict rules and regulations also high fidelity with a lot of details is diffucult to achieve with tinkering. I think in these areas it can provide new creative options which are often overlooked but these options sometimes mean that they are unachievable in real life. Next to that questions that use many different materials are also not really feasbile since you are unable to explore them all. Tinkering often gives many ideas and insight but does not give a perfect end-result that solves all.\nBalancing real-world with the fruitful mindset of tinkering I think a good combination for this would be to have a sweet spot between exploring and asking yourself questions about the real-world. For exmaple when an idea takes shape to step back put on your critical glasses and ask yourself questions such as What am i learning? What problem does this idea solve? Can this be used in the real world? After answering these questions you can decide to further explore certain ideas or comments to dive deeper.\nCritical impact of tinkering exercises A positive critical impact my tinkering exercise could have is that I am able to create and come up with many new ideas while improving my problem-solving skills and working hands-on which can be useful in other parts of my life.\nA negative impact can be that ideas might still be vague and not only answer top-level questions without deep diving into the real problems and how to solve them. Next to that the lack of direction can also contribute to this since you are also staying more on the surface.\nEnvironmental impact of a session I think that using reusable and recyclable materials can be necessary to keep down the amount of stuff and ecological footprint a session uses. Another thing can be to disassemble the materials and use them again. I think it is also important to show the people that this aspect is often overlooked and is important to think about and reflect on during and after such a session. A session should be tailored to let people fully explore but it is not always only fun and for this people need to take responsibility about they used.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/assignments/05-design-work-critical-making/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-5-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 5 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3 id=\"knowledge-resulting-from-tinkering\"\u003eKnowledge resulting from tinkering\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe knowledge resulting from tinkering in my experience is mostly problem solving skills and creativity.

I chose a metaphor about a maze since a maze can only be navigated with concepts that appear in coding. The maze is turned into a game which is played on a magnetic board from Ikea and for the set up I now used a field that is 150 x 250 mm. Since the magnetic board is bigger (400 x 600 mm) than the current playing field the maze set up can be changed to bigger and smaller fields. On this board 3D printed barriers can be put to create a maze setup. A start and end point should be determined and a character is put at the start. To navigate the character cards are available, on these cards specific movements can be found. These cards resemble different programming concepts. The player can make their own character with Lego or 3d print a figure they like.\nPlaying field part 1 Playing field part 2 Cards The player gets a lot of different cards which can be used during the game. The cards can be found below with an explanation of the used programming concepts.\nExplanation of the cards and programming concepts used Appearance of the cards General Loop If-else Function Examples using cards Below are the cards when used during the game.\nExample solving maze Loop If-else Function Tinkering process Of course I did not end up at the end product without a tinkering process. I first started coming up with ideas that I could use and that were the calendar and maze. I have a 3d printer which I wanted to use since tinkering is an on going process and I could easily tweak settings and models and also direclty see the results and process. For both of them I worked them out in more detail to see what needs to be made. The calendar was a really fun idea but for the magnets I could not come up with an idea to get them 3d printed well enough to be able to read them. That is why I chose the maze and starting by making two different types of block to see which dimensions whould fit the game best. These dimensions were 20x20mm and 25x25mm. In the pictures a side to side comparison can be found.\nCalendar idea Maze idea Block versions I chose for the bigger block since it made building a maze simple enough and the blocks were big enough that a character would fit next to them. After looking into the dimensions I looked into the options to use magnets in the blocks. In my building block I used magnets on every side of the block which in this case is not necessary since the block do not have to connect with each other, only the board. That is why I chose to put one magnets on the bottom of the block. Since I changed some parts of my 3d printer I needed to change the dimensions of the hole for the magnet to fit. After the magnets were able to fit in the block I started looking into the setup of the maze, how big the playing field should be. For this I tried to sketch it which can be seen in the pictures below. I used this sketch as layout for the maze but the layout can be changed to whatever setup the player likes. To make the field changeable I looked into how it would be the easiest to make changing borders. Since the blocks are squares they take quite long to pring and you need a lot of them to be able to make the border of the game. That is why I changed the border to rectangular blocks which have two magnets on both sides.\nThe playing field is 150 x 250 mm and each block is 25 x 25 mm, I chose to make all the borders 125 mm since the field needs an entrance and exit on the sides which means that the vertical side needs to be 150 mm - 25 mm = 125 mm. The horizontal side is 250 mm and the border block is 125 x 10 mm which means that for the horizontal side the block should be 250 + 2*10 = 270 mm. To see if the same rectangular block can be used I divided 270 / 2 = 135 mm. Since the lengts of the vertical and horizontal blocks do not differ that much I used the same length of 125 mm for both sides. This leaves the corners not completely blocked but makes it easier to change the field and removew the need for many different pieces.\nMaze idea sketches Maze playing field sketch Playing field setup sketch After making all the sketches I started printing the block and modelling the rectangular block. The printer had a lot of printing time and some difficulties with settings and normal Ender 3d printer problems. I tweaked some settings and changed the infill to 10% since the blocks do not have to be strong. Some prints had trouble with being the correct hole size for the magnet so I adjusted the holes with a screwdriver which worked fine and then the magnets fit tightly.\nBlock model Rectangular block model After everything was printed I set up the maze I sketched and tried to solve the maze with the cards. These are the pictures that can be seen at the cards examples. The final version of the maze is the picture at the top of this page and I really enjoyed making it!\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/individual-assignments/programming-paradigm/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"scaffolding-exercise---hack-the-maze\"\u003eScaffolding Exercise - Hack the Maze\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFor the scaffolding exercise I looked at multiple metaphors for coding.

Children are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO. Adults might need more encouragement to start, be creative and keep going assuring them that they can not do something wrong. Adults have not played in a long time so some start up time should also be kept in mind.\nRelevant Concepts Hands-on: using your hands to express your thoughts Metaphors: expressing ideas with metaphors that can be found in the LEGO Sharing \u0026amp; Safety: making sure people speak up and listen to what others say in a safe, non-judgmental environment. Teaching: Papert \u0026amp; Montessori From the Invent to Learn book chapter 5 multiple key principles by Papert and Montessori can be identified.\nThe Key Principles of Papert Constructionism: Learning happens when people are actively making something they care about. Learning through tinkering: Using a hands-on, trial-and-error approach to learning. Children should experiment, build, and refine their ideas through iterative design cycles Powerful ideas and microworlds: Learning should be about powerful ideas, concept that have lasting significance and can be applied in multiple contexts. While using microworlds, self-contained digital environments where learners could experiment with complex concepts in a simplified setting Low floor, high ceiling, wide walls: design learning environments that have a Low floor: easy to get started High ceiling: allowing for deep and complex explorations Wide walls: encouraging creativity Personal curricula: Education should be based on self-directed exploration, teachers encourage tinkering and learning together The role of computers: Using computers to extend cognitive abilities The Key Principles of Montessori Hands-on learning: Learning through direct, physical interaction with materials Prepared environment: Design classrooms to promote independent learning, every material has specific purpose Intrinsic motivation and self directed learning: Children learn best when they follow their own curiosity, use materials that are self-correcting so children discover their mistakes on their own. Freedom within limits: Children should have the freedom to choose their activities but within a carefully structured environment Mixed-age classrooms and peer learning Observation and adaption: Teachers act as guides, they step back and let children explore while intervening only when necessary Overlap Between Papert and Montessori Papert and Montessori both emphazise on active and hands-on learning and giving the children the space to decide what they want to learn. They encourage children to learn through doing and experimenting while keeping the level of instruction at the minimum. Children are encouraged to make mistakes and follor their own paths.\nDifference Between Papert and Montessori Paper and Montessori also have differences in their approach with the most prominent one being the use of technology. Papert uses computers as learning devices while Montessori prefers physical and meaningfull materials. They also differ in their way of structuring the environment around the children, Papert uses an open-ended and more explorative environment while Montessori uses a prepared environment in which children can do things within the boundaries of the environment. Lastly, Papert and Montessori also differ in their view of the role of a teacher. Papert mostly lets the teachers encourage the children to learn together and tinker while Montessori put the role as a teacher more as a guide which only intervene when necessary.\nTinkering for Children of Different Ages For young children aged 3 to 6 both of the mantra are valuable since they encourage children to explore through a hands-on approach using different materials. When a child gets older (6-12 years) Papert introduces the use of computers which opens up a whole new world of problems to solve. While Montessori still uses the same materials but with more difficult problems. Teenagers in the Papert approach use even more programming while Montessori mostly focusses on for example applications of math. Montessori has great principles which work well for young children while Papert using the computers has more relevant principles for children growing up, especially in a world where digital tools are becoming more and more important. Combining hands-on learning with physical materials with digital problem solving sounds like a future proof approach to education.\nShaping the Learning Environment Useful Pointers Space and Setting for Tinkering From the Invent to Learn book chapter 9 multiple pointers are named, these useful pointers include:\nFlexible \u0026amp; Adaptable Documentation Accessible Tools \u0026amp; Materials Culture of Experimentation The message given is that learning spaces should intentionally be designed to foster creativity, agency and self-directed exploration. Makerspaces are not just about a place to use tools and materials but are about setting a mindset where poeple see themselves as inventors and problem-solvers.\nNecessity of a Designlab/Fablab A designlab/fablab is not needed since the mindset about making and being an inventor can be used everywhere. The most important things are that the environment supports creativity and exploration.\nPractice as a Designer/Engineer Using Tinkering I use Tinkering in the ideation and prototyping phase of a project. In the ideation phase I use it to generate multiple ideas. In the prototyping phase I mostly use it to explore different features and test the prototypes.\nTranslating Design and Research Problems into a Tinkering Playground A design or research problem can be translated into a tinkering playground through breaking it into smaller parts which can be solved by using open-ended materials. After solving the smaller parts it can be combined to solve the bigger problem.\nGetting Unstuck Things to use when you get stuck are to use different materials then the ones currently used and also looking in the world around you to see how the problem can be seen in other ways so looking for an analogous solution. It can also be useful to involve others in your tinkering process to get different perspectives and solutions and work around the part were you are stuck at. Another option is to stop and go for a walk to give your brain some rest and focus on other things.\nGetting in the Flow To get in the flow I make sure that people are not able to distract me and that there are a lot of different materials present. I feel like just starting and doing random stuff also helps to start the ideas. I mostly start sketching or making stuff with 3d modelling or LEGO blocks to see which options can be found. After the first options are there you can explore one of the options or generate more options. I can completely lose myself once I start seeing multiple options and want to explore them all.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/assignments/03-facilitation2/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"week-3-reflective-questions\"\u003eWeek 3 Reflective Questions\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"lego-serious-play\"\u003eLEGO Serious Play\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003ch4 id=\"role-of-adults-in-facilitation\"\u003eRole of Adults in Facilitation?\u003c/h4\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eChildren are often used to just starting to play and seeing what is happening especially with LEGO.

the material table I chose the criteria of self guiding, preciousness, skills needs, interoperability, seeing the process and seeing the results. I chose these criteria since I felt like they support creativity, exploration and learning by doing. The criteria appeared in the \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; chapter and in affordances by Norman. My definitions of the criteria are:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Material Table"},{"content":"Week 2 Reflective Questions I was not physically present during session two and received some information from peers but that was not very useful. I looked into the concept of Affordance and searched for all the different materials online to make the material table. The table can be found on the material table tab.\nThe concept of affordance is used to give a better understanding about what makes materials good for tinkering. The concept of affordance can be viewed from two perspectives, namely Gibson and Norman. Gibson is focussed on the ecological psychology [1] and Norman used the human-computer interaction (HCI) framework [2].\nGibson in 1977 defined affordance as \u0026ldquo;offers the animal, what it provides or furnishes, either for good or ill\u0026rdquo; [3] So in other words it refers to all action possibilities with an object based on user\u0026rsquo;s physical capabilities [4].\nIn 1988 Norman introduces the concept of affordance to the design community and changed the definition a bit so it could be easier used for designers [4]. He defined it as \u0026ldquo;perceivable action possibilities\u0026rdquo; in other words only actions which users consider possible. Designer must keep affordances in mind when designing product or services since elements of their design suggest how user can use their product or services.\nConnecting the concept of affordance to tinkering materials shows us that the materials that have clear affordances help people tinker. They invite people to start exploring and use the materials in different ways. Materials that suggest that they can be used in multiple ways encourage creativity, learning and experimentation.\nFrom the chapter \u0026ldquo;Designing for Tinkerability\u0026rdquo; it also becomes clear that they emphaze to create an environment and tools that support open-ended exploration and invention. Their view on making designs that are intuitive and invite interaction closely relate to Norman and his view on the perceived affordances. Through the use of materials and tools that suggest their functionalities, a tinkering mindset is encouraged.\nCombining all of the frameworks and opinions this means that in tinkering, materials that have multiple functionalities and that suggest their possibilities need to be designed or used to encourage exploration. This helps people to know what we can do with things just by looking or touching them [4].\nReferences\nWikipedia contributors. (n.d.). James Jerome Gibson. Wikipedia.

For my building block I first started making a lot of different sketches which can be seen below. I started with thinking about a lot of different shapes and existing building blocks. After that I tried to combine parts to get a new building block.\nSketches of building block shapes With the block itself more clear I started thinking about different ways to connect the blocks. After I made all the sketches I looked back and looked at what would be feasible to make. I chose the square form since it can be easily modelled and I chose to connect the block with magnets since they are versitile to use and connect blocks in different places. Magnets are also a part which does not break easily compared to a 3d printed interlocking system.\nSketches of connecting blocks Building Block Progress Week 2 I made the model for my building block and bought magnets to insert in the holes. The 3d printer unfortunately had no interest in helping me. I tried troubleshooting for three days but still the problems were not gone. I tried to change multiple settings but the printer could not print the model correctly. I also tried printing other models but the problems remained. In short, 3d printers are amazing when they work but when they don\u0026rsquo;t they get on your nerves! The problem was not solveable within this week so I went to Designlab to get it printed. Below you can see the results!\nEnd result One block Stack of blocks Print failures Failures More failures Models Test model Block model Alternative model I tried making the alternative model but came to the conclusion that it is difficult to connect the square with a pentagon. So I let that one be an idea that was not executed. It can however still be a fun thing to later explore how to connect different shapes easily and maybe design a block that has different sides, for example having both squares and pentagons.\n","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/masteringtinkering/individual-assignments/building-block/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"building-block-progress-week-1\"\u003eBuilding Block Progress Week 1\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe design assignment was to come up with your own design of a construction/building block for which in next session we were going to build a physical prototpye.

In these domains the tinkering helps to create prototypes and also iterate these prototypes to see in what ways a prototype can be made and what can be changed. After that the tinkering helps to combine all of these prototypes into one main idea.\nTo get away from my screen I like to take pictures and make drawings.\nI have a lot of item on my wishlist but the main ones are to have a 3D printer that is able to print TPU and a soldering station.\nReflective Questions Question 1 Definitions according to the Cambridge Dictionary [1]\nTinkering: to make small changes to something, especially in an attempt to repair or improve it Trial-and-error: a way of achieving an aim or solving a problem by trying a number of different methods and learning from the mistakes that you make Brainstorming: an activity or business method in which a group of people meet to suggest a lot of new ideas for possible development All three have to do with improving or solving a problem Improving an existing product or coming up with a new product Ways of creating new ideas and products\nThe definition of tinkering from the dictionary has more to do with making changes to something that exists while the definition in the course is more about using materials to epxlore options. To explore options also small changes can be made. The dictionary definition is directed at a goal to repair or improve something but the course definition does not start with a goal. Exploring options is most often also done in small steps so in that way they match.\nAI tool [2] Definition\nTinkering: This is an open-ended, hands-on approach to learning and problem-solving. It involves experimenting with materials and ideas through playful exploration, allowing for creativity and personal expression. Tinkering encourages individuals to identify problems and work on solving them in creative ways, often without a predetermined outcome. Trial-and-Error: This method involves attempting various solutions to a problem until finding one that works. It\u0026rsquo;s a process of making repeated, varied attempts, learning from mistakes, and gradually approaching a desired result. This approach is fundamental in learning and problem-solving, emphasizing persistence and adaptation. Brainstorming: A creative technique where individuals or groups generate a multitude of ideas to address a specific issue or challenge. This method encourages open thinking and the free flow of ideas, promoting innovative solutions and collaboration. Comparison:\nApproach:\nTinkering: Hands-on, experimental, and iterative, focusing on exploration and making. Trial-and-Error: Systematic testing of various solutions until success is achieved. Brainstorming: Idea generation through discussion, without immediate evaluation. Outcome:\nTinkering: May lead to unexpected discoveries or innovations. Trial-and-Error: Aims to find a working solution through elimination. Brainstorming: Produces a broad range of ideas for potential solutions. Process:\nTinkering: Involves playful interaction with materials and concepts. Trial-and-Error: Involves testing and learning from failures. Brainstorming: Involves collaborative ideation Does the Course Definition Match the Dictionary Definition? Yes, but with more depth! The course definition aligns with the dictionary definition of tinkering in that both emphasize hands-on, exploratory, and iterative approaches.\nKey Difference: The course definition is more structured in its description of the tinkering process, emphasizing:\nThe progression from undirected play to goal-driven experimentation. The role of trial-and-error as a fundamental method. The influence of serendipity rather than strict structure. What aspects does the answer miss? The AI definition does not state that tinkering can also be done with a goal in mind. The AI definition also misses the broad settings in which Tinkering can be used. The AI states it as an approach to learn and problem solve while the course talks about it being a mindset.\nQuestion 2 The project I have chosen is the Smirnoff - Mindtunes project [3] in which they use Brain Computer Interfacing to make music. This is done to give people who are tetraplegic the opportunity to be creative and make music together using only their brains. They transform emotion into brainwaves and then into sounds waves to make a song together.\nThe 5 technical hurdles the project faced are:\nSensor accuracy Controlling thoughts Connecting all three persons to different instruments with their emotions controlling different parts of the music Noise in the BCI data Calibrating to each individual Question 3 I would go hunting for tinkerspiration at these physical and online places:\nPhysical:\nAbility Tech FabLabs Makerspaces Designlab Museums Online:\nThingiverse Instructables Instagram YouTube Arduino Project Hub I have gotten inspiration from a lot of YouTube videos and made projects which were available on Thingiverse. I have found multiple project on Thingiverse which are still on my bucket list and to be made list. For example completing the InMoov [4] robot which can be seen in the image below.\nQuestion 4 The 5 domains, challenges or setting I would like to apply tinkering in are:\nAssitive technology Why? Designing accessible personalized products for people with a disability. It is a way of coming up with small ideas that can improve the daily life of a person with a disability dramatically. For example a 3D printed part which can hold down greens on the counter for a person which is able to use one hand. Music Why? To create alternative ways to create music. For example the Smirnoff mindtunes, so giving someone who is not able to hold a physical instrument the change to still play music. Public transport Why? Public transport is constantly searching for improvements but the tracks are not easy to change so tinkering can mean something for the world around the tracks. For example changing the inside of a train with ambient lights or different seating options that create a welcoming and nice feeling and next to that to create interactive things at the stations waiting rooms. Student housing Why? Tinkering could be used to see what students would come up with for their own house and thus tailor a house to their needs. Since they are students they might come up with crazy ideas for which they are able to test them themselves since they often do research. For example a ideas to creative ideas to create more spacee in a small room. Mental health Why? People can come up with everything they want which can work therapeutic since a person is able to let go off all their thoughts and stress because they focus on doing something with their hands. For example for a person with autism to make something that expresses their emotions. The sweetspots are in domains where a person is able to constantly change and thus iterate on ideas. I don\u0026rsquo;t think there are untinkerable domains since it can always give ideas but in the medicine world it would be dangerous to use medicines that have not been tested. So it is also important that there are no risks or certain restrictions to tinkering in a domain.\nReferences\nCambridge University Press. (n.d.). Cambridge Dictionary.

In these domains the tinkering helps to create prototypes and also iterate these prototypes to see in what ways a prototype can be made and what can be changed. After that the tinkering helps to combine all of these prototypes into one main idea.\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Reflection 01 Getting Started"},{"content":"My name is Madelon Gorter.
