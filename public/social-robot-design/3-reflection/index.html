The lesson applying to my case is to use motion as communication. As stated in the paper &ldquo;By prioritizing the quality and communicative properties of movement over pragmatic function or aesthetic form, we can give proper attention to the importance of movement in human communication and perception.&rdquo;, before the lesson I did not know how important motion was to express emotions. During the lecture it became clear that even using a simple waterbottle and putting a piece of paper around that, already is able to show some form of emotion. Next to that I was more focussed on the actual expression of a face to express emotion and now knowing that motion is a big key factor makes it very interesting to see what you can achieve without a face or eyes. Also the lesson about using more non-antromorphic robots shows how if we do not give a robot certain human-like features the attribution of emotions is different. Since we perchieve them not as human-like and creates a cognitive dissonance however, I find it very fascinating to combine non-antromorphic robot and motion to see how well emotion can be perceived even tho they are not directly expressed. I also think that using the Wizard of Oz technique a lot of emotions or expressions can be tested which would be nice to use in our own case.">

<h2 id="laban-framework--alternatives">Laban Framework &amp; Alternatives<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#laban-framework--alternatives">#</a></h2>
<p>The Laban Movement Analysis (LMA) framework is a structured system for understanding and describing human movement [1]. H. Knight et al. [2] used the framework to develop a set of motion features to analyze and eventually generate expressive movements in robots, mostly focussed on robot with a limited degrees of freedom. From the study it became clear that LMA principles can enhance expressiveness of robots especially in a play where non-verbal cues are used in the interaction. A. LaViers et al. also used the LMA framework to provide a non-verbal embodied vocabulary for designing robot motion that feels meaningful or intentional to humans. An important point from the study is that the LMA framework allowed the designers to create expressive movement without needing to anthropomorphize the robot.</p>
<p>One alternative to Laban is the Legibility Evaluation that is used by S. Wallkötter et al. [4], it is focussed on evaluating how understandable robot actions are and what the robot is doing and why. It is more an evalution of robots compared to Laban which is focussed on creating expressive motion.</p>
<p>Laban is the main route since it can be used both to analyze human motion and generate robot motion. Every discipline is able to use this framework to create expressive motion for robots in a non-humanoid form.</p>
<h2 id="designing-movement-to-achieve-intentionality">Designing Movement to Achieve Intentionality<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#designing-movement-to-achieve-intentionality">#</a></h2>
<p>The main part of the statement is about that a robot doesn&rsquo;t need to behave like a human, it just needs to act in a way that humans can interpret as intentional. For this I would use a combination of the above mentioned approaches namely Laban and Motion Legibility to focus on creating understandable expressive motion.</p>
<h2 id="sound-design-and-haptics-as-means-for-expression">Sound Design and Haptics as Means for Expression<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sound-design-and-haptics-as-means-for-expression">#</a></h2>
<p>For sound design the auditory icons/earcons can be used in social robots to communicate an intention or emotion through a sound. Auditory icons are real-world sounds that have a semantic, intuitive link to the event they represent and earcons are abstract, musical or synthetic tones that follow a structured logic, like a system of beeps or motifs [5].</p>
<p>For haptics the Tactons/tactile icons framework [6] can be used in social robots to create vibration patterns or tactile cues to communicate expressions non-virtually. They are analogous to the earcons but then in the tactile domain. Touch patterns are mapped to meanings using: frequency, amplitude, duration, rhythm and location [6]. Manipulating these parameters creates different types of tactile messages.</p>
<h2 id="design-space-of-a-anti-social-robot">Design Space of a anti-Social Robot<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#design-space-of-a-anti-social-robot">#</a></h2>
<p>The design space of an anti-social robot would be to create environments in which the robot behaves in a way that does not contribute to humans. It can focus on the relationship we want with robots and challenge our assumptions made about robots when for example a robot is being rude. It can show a completely different side to social interaction with a robot. Next to that it can also be helpful to create only functional robot that do not need social interaction.</p>
